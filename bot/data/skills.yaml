    Kinesics is the art of empathy and nonverbal communication.

    Use Kinesics to read someone’s emotional state, gauge their
    intentions, detect lies, identify mannerisms and tells, and use body
    language to emote and convey information. Kinesics is used to
    oppose Deceive skill.

    Though synthmorphs are designed to emote, reading them is more
    difficult; apply a –30 modifier. The same modifier also applies to ALIs
    that are operating pods, bots, or synthmorphs. At the GM’s discretion,
    similar modifiers may apply to morphs that lack anthropomorphic
    characteristics or that are sleeved by egos accustomed to much
    different physiologies (such as a neo-octopi in a neo-avian morph).

    _<:Insight:821743329297301504>  Know, Field_

    Know skill represents your accumulated knowledge in a field of
    work, study, or interest. They
    play a less dramatic role, but are often critical for helping your
    character solve mysteries, understand situations, and figure out
    what to do.

    Know skills are loosely grouped into four types: academics, arts,
    interests, and professional training.
know academics:
  title: "Know Academics"
  parent: skills
  text: >
    _<:Insight:821743329297301504>  Know, Field/Cognition_

    Academic fields cover all of the disciplines of scientific knowledge
    and advanced study. They include theoretical and applied
    sciences, social sciences, transhumanities, and technology.

    Use Academics to call upon your education. For example, Know:
    Chemistry could be used to identify a particular substance, understand
    an unusual chemical reaction, or determine what elements are
    needed to nanofabricate something that requires exotic materials.
    The GM may choose not to allow defaulting on some Know Tests, as
    only someone who has been educated in that subject is likely to be
    able to tackle it.

    **Sample Fields**: Archeology, Astrobiology, Astronomy, Astrophysics,
    Astrosociology, Biology, Botany, Chemistry, Computer
    Science, Cryptography, Economics, Engineering, Genetics,
    Geology, History, Law, Linguistics, Mathematics, Memetics,

  parent: skills
  text: >
    _<:Insight:821743329297301504>  Know, Field/Intuition_

    Art fields include various modes of artistic expression and evaluation.
    This is a particularly useful skill in economies and clades where
    creativity and vision can be a key component of your reputation.

    Use Art fields to bring your imagination to life, create a work of
    art, critique an artist’s style or performance, or appraise an artistic
    project’s worth.

    Note that Art fields should not be used in place of Active skills
    to directly deceive, influence, or sway others. Crafting a realistic
    augmented reality illusion requires Program skill, incorporating
    a hidden message within a public song or speech would rely on
    Deceive skill, making a speech to convince a panel or rally a crowd
    requires Persuade or Provoke. However, Art fields may be used as
    complementary skills ▶53 in such cases.

    **Sample Fields**: Architecture, AR Design, Criticism, Dance, Drama,
    Drawing, Music, Painting, Performance, Sculpture, Singing,
