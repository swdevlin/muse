    Your character has a reputation score in different social networks.

    necessary gear. Rep scores are used as your target number for Rep
    Tests. There are seven rep networks to choose from:

    • @-rep: The Circle-A List, for autonomists, anarchists, Titanians,
    scum, and Extropians.

    • c-rep: CivicNet, used by the Planetary Consortium, Morningstar
    Constellation, Lunar-Lagrange Alliance, Jovian Republic, and other
    hypercorps and capitalists.

    • f-rep: Fame, the media network used by metacelebrities, journalists,
    socialites, artists, and glitterati.

    • g-rep: Guanxi, the network for triads, cartels, gangs, and other
    criminal groups.

    • i-rep: The Eye, Firewall’s secret internal network.
