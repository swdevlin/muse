    Aerostats are balloons, relying on buoyant gases for lift in atmospheres,
    maneuvering with turbofans. Their low signature and longevity make them
    ideal for high-altitude surveillance, research, or gas mining.

    Specks are very small insectoid spy drones, roughly the size of a small
    fruit fly. They fly with tiny wings and are excellent for surveillance
    purposes or otherwise being a “speck on a wall.” Specks are difficult to
    notice (−30 Perceive modifier) and almost impossible to distinguish from
    an actual insect.

    Creepies come in an eclectic variety of forms, from robo-squirrels
    to insectoids to bizarre artsy mechanical creatures. Creepies were
    originally designed as a robotic pet, but are commonly used as a
    general-purpose household minion, like a more beloved servitor. Many
    people wear a creepy on their person, dropping it to handle small tasks
    for them and letting it crawl up, down, and over their body.

    This bot takes the form of an extra limb and a supportive band, bracing
    frame, rig, or cuff for wearing it. The manipulator can be meshed and
    treated as an extension of your body or detached for autonomous
    operation or remote control. Though human arm designs are common, a variety
    of limb designs are available, from claws to tentacles. Treat as a
    cyberlimb plus when worn.

    Servitors are the most common robot, acting as cooks, janitors,
    universal helpers, movers, and personal aides. Every home has one,
    if not several. They come in a variety of non-humanoid shapes and
    sizes, though most are medium sized, with 4–8 limbs on average.

    This hand-shaped bot scurries like a spider. It functions as a
    detachable hand for a cyberarm, though it is sometimes used by
    uplifts or other morphs who need a hand design for certain tasks. Its
    “legs” are more articulated than human fingers and can rotate/bend in
    any direction. Though this bot does not have the leverage of a full
    arm/body behind it, it can extend a meter-long brace for stabilization
    and support.
