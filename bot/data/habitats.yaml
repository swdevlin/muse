planetary habitats:
  title: Planetary habitats

  parent: habitats
  text: >
    Planetary habitats can exist on any planet, moon, or asteroid where
    the natural gravity is sufficient to allow for walking without being
    aloft for an excessive period of time. The lower bound of what is
    considered a planetary habitat is arbitrary and overlaps with the
    upper bound of microgravity habitats.


    For those who are only familiar with spin gravity and have never
    been planetside, nor experienced XP or VR of a gravitational world,
    there are a few things to note. On a gravitational world, it is not
    readily apparent which direction is prograde or retrograde, or where
    the axis of rotation is. There is no perceptible change in rotational
    velocity or gravity when moving up or down in a structure, the elevators
    never tilt or move in a curved path, and the quixotic curves of
    thrown or flying objects are at best parabolic. This can all be a bit
    disorienting and bland if you are unaccustomed to it.
dome:
  title: Dome
  page: 116
  parent: planetary habitats
  text: >
    Domed habitats are an enclosed, pressurized area on the surface of a
    planetary body. These can range from large tents to cities of thousands.
    The environment internal to the dome is engineered to be Earthlike.
    Impact craters, with the crater rim serving as a natural base
    for the usually tessellated roof architecture, are favorite locations
    for domes. There are typically airlocks to the surface as well as
    extensive underground habitation areas. Underground transport
    between domes and other habitats is not uncommon. Domes are
    usually made transparent during day cycles; larger cities project
    video or holographic displays on the dome interior. Dome fabrics
    are protective and self-repairing but not indestructible. Some are
    covered with a coating derived from local materials for insulation
    and protection from micrometeors and radiation.
subsurface:
  title: Subsurface
  page: 116
  parent: planetary habitats
  text: >
    Subsurface habitats include any kind of underground mineshaft,
    lava tube, cavern, or other structure, either naturally formed or excavated.
    The primary advantages of subsurface habitats are protection
    from radiation and any harsh elements on the surface. Subsurface
    habitats are common throughout the Solar System and are extensive
    on Luna, Mars, Mercury, and the Jovian satellites.
bathyscaphe:
  title: Bathyscaphe
  page: 116
  parent: planetary habitats
  text: >
    First built to explore the deep oceans of Earth, bathyscaphes provide
    a breathable atmosphere in aquatic environments and are usually
    pressurized at near-Earth normal. They tend to be heavily built as
    they must withstand high pressures at depth. Bathyscaphes are
    common in the subsurface oceans of Enceladus, Ceres, and Europa,
    and are known to exist with similar function on exoplanets with
    high-pressure atmospheres as well as the surface of Venus. Larger
    bathyscaphes are anchored to the floor of the environment (or, in
    the case of Europa, the crustal ice ceiling), while smaller bathyscaphes
    are mobile and can explore the depths. Airlocked moon
    pools allow access to the aquatic environment.
aerostat:
  title: Aerostat
  page: 117
  parent: planetary habitats
  text: >
    Aerostats are voluminous structures that float in a dense atmosphere.
    Their distinguishing features are lightweight structures
    and large internal spaces that are at a lower density than the
    surrounding atmosphere, thus providing lift. To provide stability,
    the expansive chambers that provide lift are located towards the top
    of the structure, with the bulk of the habitation space and docking
    facilities typically positioned on the underside, though some are
    known to have landing platforms or synthmorph living areas on
    the roof of the structure. Aerostats are common on Venus and also
    present in the clouds of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Most aerostats
    drift with the currents, though some are tugged or tethered to
    the surface.
centrifugal habitats:
  title: Centrifugal Habitats
  page: 117
  parent: habitats
  text: >
    There are many varieties of and philosophies behind centrifugal
    habitats. Their defining feature is rotation. A person on the interior
    surface of a rotating hab will experience a force that simulates
    gravity (usually Earth or Mars standard). This force will always
    be perpendicular to and away from the axis of rotation (meaning
    that you stand on the inside of the rim with your head pointing
    up towards the axis). The faster the rotation, the stronger the
    force. As you climb nearer to the axis, thus reducing your angular
    velocity, the force decreases until reaching zero gravity at the axis.


    Modern centrifugal habs can be broadly classified into three
    major types based on geometry ($list), as well as various sub-types based
    on construction method or other feature. There is no real functional
    difference as the centrifugal principles are the same.
torus:
  title: Torus
  page: 117
  parent: centrifugal habitats
  text: >
    Toroidal habitats resemble a wheel, with spokes connecting to a
    central docking station. They tend to be more simply made and
    have lower populations than other centrifugal habitat types. It is
    not unusual to see a double torus with counter-rotating sections.
    Tori are most common in low planetary orbits and often have many
    windows for viewing the planet below. When standing on the interior
    surface of a torus with large open areas, the habitat seems to
    curve upwards in two directions, until eclipsed by the ceiling. Tori
    are sometimes referred to as von Braun wheels or Stanford tori,
    based on early 20th-century conceptions.
cylinder:

    Cylindrical habitats of various sorts are the dominant type of
    centrifugal habitat. Useful classifications include: $list
o’neill cylinder:
  title: O’Neill Cylinder
  page: 117
  parent: cylinder
  text: >
    Large cylindrical habitats that are built to
    particular fixed dimensions are so named in homage to the 20th
    century physicist Gerard K. O’Neill. They tend to be large megaprojects
    and are known for having less internal segmentation, fewer
    habitation levels, and a vast internal space that recreates an Earthlike
    ecosystem. However, O’Neill’s design is considered antiquated
    by current standards. No habitat based on his original design has
    ever been built, though various modern variations exist.

    When standing on a cylinder’s interior surface, the environment
    arcs up on either side, so that the far side of the habitat is directly
    overhead, on the opposite side of the cylinder. Cylinders are
    typically large-enough to hold cities and vast sculpted landscapes.
    Many run a solar electrochemiluminescence tube along the axis that
    provides an internal day/night cycle.
fisher hab:
  title: Fisher Hab
  page: 118
  parent: cylinder
  text: >
    The prototypical modular-independent cylindrical
    habitat, named in honor of the prolific 21st century space architect
    C.F. Fisher, consists of shorter cylinders, sometimes called disk
    habitats, which are commonly joined together as new units are
    completed. This allows for reasonably large internal spaces with
    complex ecosystems — smaller versions of the megaproject O’Neill
    type habs, but with the advantage of faster construction times and
    the ability of each unit to have its own unique ecosystem or even be
    its own polity. Some units remain very independent of the others,
    with the only connection being through the central thoroughfare,
    while others open up spaces through the hulls and permanently
    fuse together. Unless the modules have been fused, it is not strictly
    necessary for each unit in a group to have the same rotational speed,
    nor is it necessary for each unit to have the same radius. As these
    units are theoretically independent, it is possible for them to leave
    a particular agglomeration and go fully independent, or to join
    another Fisher group. Fisher units often have a large number of
    habitation levels, sometimes extending from Earth gravity to Mars
    gravity or beyond, with parks and recreational spaces distributed
    throughout. While there is some variation, the length and radius of
    Fisher units tend to be standardized at about one kilometer each,
    and are rarely seen with radii greater than two kilometers. Fisher
    habitats tend to exist in confederations with each unit retaining
    relative independence.
polykatoikia:
  title: Polykatoikia
  page: 118
  parent: cylinder
  text: >
    A cylindrical habitat where the modules are dependent
    on each other is known as a polykatoikia. They consist of pods,
    rings, ring segments, or other interlocking shapes that are gradually
    built up, both along the axis of rotation and outward from it. A
    rotating assembler system allows for the addition of new segments
    without interrupting the rotation of the habitat, with the primary
    requirement being that new segments are added in a manner that
    is balanced across the axis of rotation. Segments are not normally
    designed to function independently of the habitat, and engineering
    and life support systems are typically part of the substructure of the
    habitat, which is itself built out as the habitat grows. Polykatoikia
    are known for fast construction times, smaller open spaces, and an
    often labyrinthine internal layout.
reagan cylinder:
  title: Reagan Cylinder
  page: 118
  parent: cylinder
  text: >
    The Jovian Republic’s version of a cylindrical
    habitat is the Reagan Cylinder. A large cylindrical space is carved
    out from within an asteroid, and the excavated material is affixed
    to the outside in an attempt to create stability during rotation. This
    construction method is great for protecting against the high radiation
    environment near Jupiter, but the bioconservative republic’s
    fear of advanced technologies make these habitats far less pleasant
    than they could be. Chronic problems with stability, structural
    integrity, and the reliability of life-support systems have earned
    these habitats the derisive moniker of “sarcophagus habs” by the
    other factions.
hamilton cylinder:
  title: Hamilton Cylinder
  page: 118
  parent: cylinder
  text: >
    The latest incarnation of the cylindrical
    habitat, Hamilton cylinders are the embodiment of the cutting edge,
    incorporating advanced nanotech, materials science, neuroscience,
    and computational technologies. A silicate composite exterior
    shell provides a skeleton structure and protection from space. An
    interior middle layer collects waste and resources harvested by
    drones from nearby planets, moons, or asteroids. Nanofabricators
    and bioreactors in this layer maintain an infrastructure of nanosystems
    that sustain environmental cycles. A layer of distributed
    nanocomputers functions as a neural strata — the brain of the
    cylinder — controlling various habitat systems. Hamilton cylinders
    are aware of their surroundings, both internal and external, and are
    living, growing machines. There are currently only three Hamilton
    cylinders in existence — one in the Uranian system and two at
    Saturn.
spheroid:
  title: Spheroid
  page: 118
  parent: centrifugal habitats
  text: >
    Sometimes nearly perfect spheres, but more commonly a prolate shape,
    spheroidal habitats are often referred to as Bernal spheres in honor
    of the scientist John Desmond Bernal, who first conceived of such
    habitats in 1929. The main habitation level is typically built on a band
    extending across from the same degree lines north and south of the
    equator. This gives a living surface like that of a cylinder. Beneath the
    main habitation level are further, progressively smaller habitation levels
    and engineering sections. Larger spheroids may have multiple stepped
    levels at progressively lesser gravities going out toward the poles.
ad-hoc:
  title: Ad-Hoc
  page: 118
  parent: centrifugal habitats
  text: >
    Though uncommon, it is possible to jury-rig a centrifugal habitat by
    linking modules and rotating them around a center of mass. These
    structures tend to be unstable and less-than-ideal, as the modules
    are not designed for this purpose, but it is a cheap option for Belters
    and brinkers who need spin gravity and have limited options.
beehive:
  title: Beehive
  page: 118
  parent: microgravity habitats
  text: >
    Beehives are tunnels, caverns, and excavated spaces in microgravity
    asteroids and moonlets. Most beehive habitats are created when
    squatters take over abandoned asteroid mines. With a bit of work,
    such as sealants, airlocks, and the addition of life-support and environmental
    controls, a biomorph can have a comfortable living space,
    whereas a synthmorph can get by with few or no modifications at
    all. Residents will often tunnel out additional spaces and passageways
    as the population grows. Beehives have similar advantages,
    disadvantages, and requirements to subsurface planetary habitats.
    Comets, loosely held-together rock piles, or very rapidly rotating
    asteroids are generally not suitable for beehives, and very small
    asteroids typically have stability issues that make them unsuitable.
cluster:
  title: Cluster
  page: 118
  parent: microgravity habitats
  text: >
    Clusters are congregations of specialized modules, directly interconnected
    or latticed together in orbit. With high quality construction
    and integrated support for modern technologies, a cluster can have
    all of the conveniences and opportunities of any other habitat.
nuestro shell:
  title: Nuestro Shell
  page: 119
  parent: microgravity habitats
  text: >
    Several variations exist of the Nuestro shell, but the principle design
    consists of multiple rigid spars radiating outward symmetrically from
    a central point. Additional ringed structures connect across the spars,
    allowing for movement between them and providing stability. Various
    modules are connect with the spars, rings, and each other either
    directly or via floatways. It is, in essence, a large stable framework for
    a cluster hab. Spars and rings typically have internal passageways and
    intermittently spaced airlocked docking structures that larger habitat
    modules will permanently attach to. The entire structure is contained
    within and attached to a geodesic sphere covered with a flexible, selfhealing
    mesh designed to protect against micrometeoroid impacts.
tenmai shell:
  title: Tenmai Shell
  page: 119
  parent: microgravity habitats
  text: >
    The base structure of a Tenmai shell is made from the outer shell
    of a cylindrical or spheroid centrifugal habitat, but does not house
    the expected interior structure. Instead, it contains a vast, protected,
    usually pressurized, microgravity area that can be several cubic
    kilometers in size. From the outside they look much the same as
    a centrifugal habitat of the same shape and typically have similar
    docking ports at what would have been the axis of rotation. The
    interiors are as diverse as bare-bones empty shells, a literal jungle
    of microgravity-adapted plants, the chaos of a three-dimensional,
    haphazardly created labyrinth with few right angles, or the disciplined
    order of a cubicle worker’s nightmare.
processor locus:
  title: Processor Locus
  page: 119
  text: >
    While communities of infomorphs can be found within other habitats,
    a processor locus is a dedicated computational environment
    designed exclusively for the disembodied. Also referred to as a
    noosphere, the most notable features of a processor habitat are a
    massive computational core, extensive power generation facilities,
    and research centers related to the architecture, engineering,
    programming, and evolution of computing systems. Loci run
    multiple massive simulspace environments capable of hosting tens
    of thousands of infomorphs. Regarded with suspicion by some for
    their potential to harbor AGIs or become spawn points for ASIs, as
    well as claims of engaging in banned AI and cognitive research,
    processor habitats are heavily shielded and defended.

    Egocasting into a processor locus is encouraged by its inhabitants,
    as familiarity diminishes fear. Any type of environment can
    be experienced in simulspace: flawless recreations of pre-Fall Earth,
    fantasy realms from fiction, heavenly retreats, or even bizarre and
    sometimes disturbing experiences generated on the fly from the
    memories and desires of everyone in the simulspace.
scum swarm:
  title: Scum Swarm
  page: 119
  text: >
    A Scum swarm is less a habitat and more a way of life. They originated
    with spacecraft that helped evacuate Earth. Laden with refugees, they
    were unable to find anywhere that was willing to accept them and
    essentially became nomadic refugee camps. Many clustered around
    sections of partially destroyed habitats and other structures that were
    damaged in the Fall. As the swarms traveled, these structures were
    towed by barges, retrofit with engines, or interlaced with spacecraft
    in what are known as LaFrance rig lattices. Over time, these refugees
    joined together with pre-existing nomadic peoples, becoming the
    Scum. These communities vary greatly in culture, language, organization,
    and wealth. They include everything from overcrowded
    cesspools to egalitarian anarchist communes to the gaudy opulence
    of organized crime gangs and everything in between. As roving carnivals
    of the dispossessed, they are hubs of lawlessness, piracy, black
    markets, and the bizarre. If you’re searching for the forbidden, the
    dangerous, or the deviant, you can find it here.
tin-can habitat:
  title: Tin-Can Habitat
  page: 119
  text: >
    Tin-can habitats are small modules of simple construction and
    only the most basic support systems. Many are nothing more than
    converted shipping containers. They can be solo or connected to
    large networks of tin cans or other microgravity habitats. They
    harken back to the earliest days of space flight and are disfavored
    by most who can afford something better. There are a few tin cans
    that have been in near continuous use for over a century. Curiously,
    these timeworn relics have become prized by certain antiquarians
    and retrophiles who ardently upkeep them and become experts in
    their ancient systems.
