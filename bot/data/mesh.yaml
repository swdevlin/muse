    The most heavily secure systems are air-gapped â€” physically
    separated from the mesh. They may be hardwired, lacking wireless
    transceivers, or enclosed within radio-proof barriers. The only way
    to access such systems is physically, either directly plugging in,
    defeating the radio-blocking enclosure, or somehow attaching a
    wireless transceiver to the system.
