  These biomorphs are the original bodies of various sapient non-humans.
  Though uncommon and sometimes stigmatized they are also sleeved by
  non-uplifts.


  Common morphs are:

  neo-avians:
    title: Neo-Avians
    text: >
      Neo-avians include ravens, crows, and gray parrots uplifted to human-level
      intelligence. Their physical sizes are much larger than their non-uplifted
      cousins (to the size of a human child), with larger heads for their
      increased brain size. Numerous transgenic modifications have been made to
      their wings, allowing them to retain limited flight capabilities at 1 g,
      but giving them a more bat-like physiology so they can bend and fold
      better and adding primitive digits for basic tool manipulation. Their toes
      are also more articulated and now accompanied with an opposable thumb.
      Neo-avians have adapted well to microgravity environments, and are favored
      for their small size and reduced resource use.

  neo-bonobo:
    title: Neo-Bonobo
    text: >
      Like other neo-hominids, uplifted bonobo and chimpanzee morphs feature
      enhanced intelligence and bipedal frames. Their long arms and
      prehensile feet are a boon for climbing and maneuvering in microgravity
      environments. They retain the body hair of their forebears, though it
      is a common cultural practice to dye, stylize, or otherwise manipulate
      it. Transgenic vocal systems allow them to speak as humans do.

    title: Neo-Gorilla
    text: >
      Neo-gorillas benefit from enhanced cognition and upright stances like other
      neo-hominids, though they are not as adept at climbing. They stand roughly
      as tall as humans and have stronger and larger frames.

  neo-neanderthal:
    title: Neo-Neanderthal
    text: >
      This morph is derived from fossilized Neanderthal DNA, uplifted and
      enhanced to transhuman equivalence. Neanderthal morphs appear
      muscular with a heavy bone structure, distinctively long skulls,
      heavy brow ridges, and weak chins. Pale complexions and red hair are
      common features.

  neo-octopus:
    title: Neo-Octopus
    text: >
      Colloquially known as “octomorphs,” these uplifted octopus sleeves are quite
      useful in zero-gravity environments. They retain eight arms, their chameleon
      ability to change skin color, ink sacs, and a sharp beak. They also have
      increased brain mass and longevity, can breathe both air and water, and lack
      a skeletal structure so they can squeeze through tight spaces. Octomorphs
      typically crawl along in zero gravity using their arm suckers and expelling
      air for propulsion; in low gravity they walk on two of their arms. Their
      eyes have been enhanced with color vision, provide a 360-degree field of
      vision, and rotationally adjust to keep the slitshaped pupil aligned with
      “up.” A transgenic vocal system allows them to speak.

  neo-orangutan:
    title: Neo-Orangutan
    text: >
      Neo-orangutans have the same uplifted features as their neo-hominid cousins.
      Compared to humans, their legs are shorter and arms longer. Neo-orangutans
      tend to be more solitary than social.
