    A physical body. AKA sleeve, shell, suit, jacket, form. Morphs are
    categorized as: Biomorphs, Infomorphs, Podmorphs, Synthmorphs, or
    Upliftmorphs.
biomorphs:
  title: Biomorphs
  text: >
    Biomorphs are fully biological sleeves (often genetically modified and
    equipped with implants), birthed naturally or from an exowomb, and grown
    to adulthood either naturally or at a slightly accelerated rate.
infomorphs:

    Infomorphs are digital-only forms — they lack a physical body. They are
    software mind-states on which living egos are run, though they may be
    limited by the capabilities of the hardware that supports them.

    Pods (a colloquialism derived from “pod people”) were originally
    designed as biological androids. Their parts are vat-grown separately
    using accelerated-growth processes and assembled with a number of
    cybernetic system “short-cuts;” this entire process producing a functional
    body in a fraction of the time it takes to clone a standard biomorph.
    Cyberbrains replace their undeveloped gray matter. The first generations of
    pods were operated by ALIs and primarily used in service industries where a
    biological aesthetic was preferred to robots, in hazardous labor
    industries, and for sex work. They were visually distinguished from normal
    humans by stylized seamlined patterns in their skin, a designation that
    remains common today. In the wake of the Fall and the subsequent demand for
    more biomorphs, pods are now commonly sleeved by transhumans, especially
    indentures, but they still often suffer a classist stigma. Pods lack
    reproductive functions and are usually neuter. Non-human pods are
    increasingly common.
synthmorphs:

    Most synthmorph designs were originally intended to be robots, piloted by
    ALIs. Robot forms are optimized to suit their function, and so a wide
    variety of body plans exist. Robots designed to interact with transhumans
    often have biped or quadruped walker frames, to better navigate transhuman
    dwellings and spaces, but were often distinctly non-human in appearance.
    Many feature a sort of symbolic “face,” to give transhumans something to
    look at and interact with, but these were rarely realistic, so as to avoid
    uncanny-valley creepiness.

    Since the Fall, more synthmorphs have been designed specifically for
    transhuman egos, as they are cheaper and quicker to make than biomorphs.
    Without specialized robotic functions in mind, many of these synthmorph
    designs feature anthropomorphic frames (androids and gynoids) specifically
    tailored for egos used to human forms, including heads and distinctive
    (though still non-realistic) faces. As transhumanity grows accustomed
    to synthmorphs and more creative, however, innovative and unusual
    synthmorph designs become more common-place.
upliftmorphs:

    These biomorphs are the original bodies of various sapient non-humans.
    Though uncommon and sometimes stigmatized they are also sleeved by
    non-uplifts.
