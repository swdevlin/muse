    Ware is a catch-all category for augmentations of different kinds. Unless
    otherwise noted, each ware item can only be installed in the same morph once,
    no matter if it is available in different forms.


    Available augmentation wares are:

    bioware:
        title: Bioware
        text: >
            Bioware (B) includes genetic modifications, nanosurgical tissue
            alterations, and implantation of bio-engineered organs. It is only
            available for biomorphs (including pods and uplifts). Because of its
            organic nature, bioware is hard to detect in scans; genetic testing or
            other bio-sampling is required. Use Medicine: Biotech to diagnose,
            implant, or repair.
    cyberware:
        title: Cyberware
        text: >
            Cyberware (C) is synthetic devices either implanted within a
            biological body or “grown” within using nanobots. It is only available
            for biomorphs (including pods and uplifts). Cyberware is
            detectable with x-ray and radar scans. It can also be hacked like
            other electronics. Use Medicine: Biotech to implant, Hardware:
            Electronics to repair the ware itself.
    hardware:
        title: Hardware
        text: >
            Hardware (H) includes add-ons to synthetic shells. It is only available
            for synthmorphs, bots, and vehicles. It can be hacked. Use
            Hardware: Robotics or an appropriate field for vehicles to install,
            diagnose, and repair. Many non-ware gear items can be mounted
            on or incorporated into a shell’s frame as hardware (GM discretion).
    meshware:
        title: Meshware
        text: >
            Meshware (M) refers to plug-in apps that enhance infomorphs.
            These may also be installed with cyberbrains. They are vulnerable
            to mesh combat. Use Program to install, diagnose, or repair.
    nanoware:
        title: Nanoware
        text: >
            Nanoware (N) refers to internal nanobot systems active within a
            body or shell. Nanoware includes an implanted hive that maintains
            and refreshes the nanobots. It is available for morphs of all types.
            Nanoware hives are detectable like cyberware, but the bots are
            only detectable with nanodetectors or detailed biological sampling.
            Nanoware can be hacked like other electronics. Use Medicine:
            Biotech or Hardware: Robotics to implant/repair.
