arachnoid:
  title: Arachnoid
  text: >
    Arachnoid shells mimic the shapes of spiders, termites, ants, beetles, and
    other arthropods. Three or four sets of pneumatic limbs are capable of
    rotating around their meter-long torso, and an additional set of
    manipulator arms near the head enables fine manipulation and tool use.
    Arachnoids move by walking, hopping, extending omnidirectional mini-wheels
    for skating movement, or by retracting their limbs and maneuvering with
    vectored-air thrusters in microgravity.

case:

    Cases are mass-produced robotic shells, an affordable resleeving option for
    the poor, though of notoriously poor quality. They are available in many
    varieties to suit a client’s taste. Most case morphs are anthropomorphic,
    with a thin framework body standing just shorter than an average human.

dragonfly:
  title: Dragonfly
  text: >
    The dragonfly takes the shape of a meter long flexible shell with eight
    wings, four manipulator limbs, and a prehensile tail. Capable of
    near-silent flight in Earth gravity, dragonfly bots fare even better in
    microgravity. Their wings operate independently and can rotate, allowing
    for graceful maneuvering, hovering, and tight turns.

galatea:
  title: Galatea
  text: >
    This high-end shell was designed to increase the appeal and social
    acceptance of synthmorphs. Galateas look expensive and their mental
    architecture is crafted to enhance the wearer’s personality and
    charm. Though many media icons have embraced this morph’s novelty,
    biochauvinists still view it as a monstrosity.

reaper:
  title: Reaper
  text: >
    The reaper is a combat morph in the form of an armored disc, so that it can
    turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. Four legs/manipulating arms and
    four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. It uses vector-thrust nozzles
    to maneuver in microgravity and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for
    fast movement over distance. Reapers are infamous due to military sims
    and Fall XPs; bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise
    eyebrows if not get you arrested.

    Slitheroid shells take the form of a humanoid torso with retractable
    arms atop a 2-meter-long segmented metallic snake. Slitheroids use
    lateral undulation to move, though they can also pull themselves along
    by their arms or coil, twist, and roll their bodies like a ball or hoop.

    Spares are small, portable shells designed as a temporary replacement
    sleeve should your primary morph be killed/destroyed. They are common
    gear for gatecrashing missions. Packed as a flat 15-centimeter disc, when
    activated they pop into a six-limbed spherical shape. Just plug your
    original cortical stack in and you are ready to go. Built-in
    stress-management systems help survivors handle the trauma of their recent death.

swarmanoid:
  title: Swarmanoid
  text: >
    Swarmanoids are swarms composed of hundreds of insect-sized microbots. Each
    individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters,
    or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The cyberbrain, cortical stack,
    and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm
    can “meld” together into various loose shapes, it is incapable of physical
    tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding. Individual bots are linked by
    radio and laser and are quite capable of interfacing with electronics.
    Swarmanoids follow swarm rules ▶344.

    Synths are even more humanoid than cases and of better quality. They are
    commonly deployed for labor-intensive tasks in environments not suited for
    biomorphs or for people who need a body quickly and cheaply or simply on a
    transient basis. Most designs are anthropomorphic, though various
    alternatives exist, including some based on uplift physiology.
