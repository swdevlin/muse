    **TL 0 (Primitive)**: No technology. TL 0 species have only discovered the
    simplest tools and principles, and are on a par with Earth’s Stone Age.
    
    **TL 1 (Primitive)**: Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology.
    TL 1 science is mostly superstition, but they can manufacture weapons and
    work metals.
    
    **TL 2 (Primitive)**: Renaissance technology. TL 2 brings with it a greater
    understanding of chemistry, physics, biology and astronomy as well as the
    scientific method.
    
    **TL 3 (Primitive)**: The advances of TL 2 are now applied, bringing the
    germ of industrial revolution and steam power. Primitive firearms now
    dominate the battlefield. This is roughly comparable to the early 
    19th century.

    **TL 4 (Industrial)**: The transition to industrial revolution is complete,
    bringing plastics, radio and other such inventions. Roughly comparable to
    the late 19th/early 20th century.
    
    **TL 5 (Industrial)**: TL 5 brings widespread electrification,
    tele-communications and internal combustion. At the high end of the TL, 
    atomics and primitive computing appear. Roughly on a par with the mid–20th
    century.
    
    **TL 6 (Industrial)**: TL 6 brings the development of fission power and
    more advanced computing. Advances in materials technology and rocketry
    bring about the dawn of the space age.

    **TL 7 (Pre-Stellar)**: A pre-stellar society can reach orbit reliably and
    has telecommunications satellites. Computers become common. At the time of
    writing, humanity is currently somewhere between TL 7 and TL 8.
    
    **TL 8 (Pre-Stellar)**: At TL 8, it is possible to reach other worlds in
    the same system, although terraforming or full colonisation are not
    within the culture’s capacity. Permanent space habitats become possible.
    Fusion power becomes commercially viable.
    
    **TL 9 (Pre-Stellar)**: The defining element of TL 9 is the development
    of gravity manipulation, which makes space travel vastly safer and
    faster. This research leads to development of the jump drive, which occurs
    near the end of this Tech Level. TL 9 cultures can colonise other worlds,
    although travelling to a colony is often a one-way trip.

    **TL 10 (Early Stellar)**: With the advent of commonly available jump drives,
    nearby systems are opened up. Orbital habitats and factories become common.
    Interstellar travel and trade lead to an economic boom. Colonies become much
    more viable.
    
    **TL 11 (Early Stellar)**: The first true artificial intelligences become
    possible, as computers are able to model synaptic networks. Grav-supported
    structures reach to the heavens. Jump 2 travel becomes possible, allowing
    easier travel beyond the one jump stellar mains.
    
    **TL 12 (Average Stellar)**: Weather control revolutionises terraforming
    and agriculture. Man-portable plasma weapons and carrier-mounted fusion
    guns make the battlefield untenable for unarmoured combatants. Jump 3
    travel is developed.
    
    **TL 13 (Average Stellar)**: The battle dress appears on the battlefield
    in response to the new weapons. Cloning of body parts becomes easy.
    Advances in hull design and thruster plates means that spacecraft can
    easily go underwater. Jump 4 travel.
    
    **TL 14 (Average Stellar)**: Fusion weapons become manportable. Flying cities
    appear. Jump 5 travel.
    
    **TL 15 (High Stellar)**: Black globe generators suggest a new direction
    for defensive technologies, while the development of synthetic anagathics
    means that the human lifespan is now vastly increased. Jump 6 travel.

    Tech levels are measured from 0 (no technology) to 15, the typical maximum
    tech level in known space.
