    the Traveller’s Aid Society (TAS) is a private organisation that maintains
    hostels and facilities at all class A and B starports in many parts of
    human space. Facilities are available (at reasonable cost) to members and
    their guests. Membership is for life and is not transferable.
    
    
    Membership may be purchased for MCr1, although it is possible for an
    application to be ‘black-balled’ by an existing member. The Traveller’s
    Aid Society is an exclusive organisation, made up of those who are truly
    citizens of the galaxy, not just a single world.
    
    
    The TAS invests its membership fees and other incomes; it uses its capital
    and return to provide benefits to its members. TAS Hostels offer medical
    facilities to members, as well as supplies and luxuries not normally found
    on most worlds. Every two months, it pays dividends in the form of
    one high passage to each member. This passage may be used, retained or sold.
