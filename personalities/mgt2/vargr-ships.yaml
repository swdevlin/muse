Aakum Heavy Fighter:

  aliases:
    - Aakum
  text: >
    **40 tons  M9**
    
    The Aakum is the most common fighter
    craft used by Vargr military organisations
    and it appears in many corsair bands. It
    is fast enough and tough enough to battle
    other fighters, while carrying enough
    firepower to assault larger vessels with
    some effectiveness.
Aetin Scout:
  category: Ship
  page: AoCS 226
  aliases:
    - Aetin
  text: >
    **100 tons  J2 M2**
    
    Using a 100-ton hull, the Aetin scout is
    primarily used by the navy and corsair
    bands for reconnaissance and ground
    support duties but also lone prospectors
    and explorers. Much like its Imperial
    counterpart, the Aetin scout is a common
    sight in the Extents and therefore easy to
    maintain and repair.
    
    The Aetin scout only requires a crew of
    one pilot but a gunner is carried as well
    if weapons are mounted in the standard
    double turret. Two additional crew or
    personnel can be carried with double
    occupancy if required.
Koerae Trader:
  category: Ship
  page: AoCS 228
  aliases:
    - Koerae
  text: >
    **200 tons  J2 M2**
    
    This interstellar trading vessel is built on a
    200-ton hull and is used extensively in the
    Vargr Extents. Like most Vargr ships, the
    Koerae is armoured to provide protection
    against the many corsair bands that prowl
    the trade lanes. While not sufficient to
    keep the Koerae safe in pitched battle, the
    thin armour is deemed enough to buy time
    to escape an attacker.
Avouz Courier:
  category: Ship
  page: AoCS 230
  aliases:
    - Avouz
  text: >
    **200 tons  J3 M3**
    
    Using a 200-ton hull, the Avouz courier
    is designed for the fast transport of
    emissaries and messages over interstellar
    distances. The courier is generally used
    by military and government organisations
    for diplomatic and intelligence purposes
    but its performance makes it attractive to
    explorers, corsairs and Travellers alike.
Rradhi Seeker:
  category: Ship
  page: AoCS 232
  aliases:
    - Rradhi
  text: >
    **200 tons  J1 M1**
    
    The Rradhi seeker is a versatile ship
    designed for mining and prospecting. The
    normal crew consists of a pilot, navigator,
    engineer and medic, although some multi-skilled
    prospectors will attempt to fly the
    ship on their own. Up to four additional
    workers can join the crew with double
    occupancy if required, although care has to
    be taken that this does not reduce profits.
Akalvo Yacht:
  category: Ship
  page: AoCS 234
  aliases:
    - Akalvo
  text: >
    **300 tons  J2 M5**
    
    The Akalvo is a luxury pleasure craft â€“ but
    most certainly built for Vargr. Built for
    speed as much as comfort, the interior is
    a riot of colour and trimmings, pitched
    perfectly to awe lesser Vargr. To the eyes of
    other races, however, it appears the height
    of vulgarity. Akalvo yachts are sold directly
    to wealthy Vargr who have made their
    fortunes in business or raiding ventures,
    although the latter have been known to
    continue their corsair life from the bridges
    of these ships.
Ruguelka Corsair:
  category: Ship
  page: AoCS 236
  aliases:
    - Reguelka
  text: >
    **400 tons  J2 M5**
    
    Using a small but potent 400-ton hull, the
    Ruguelka is the raiding vessel of choice
    for most corsair bands. It is a common
    sight in Vargr space and one feared by
    many Travellers. Extremely fast, it is hard
    to escape from once an intercept course
    has been set and it can carry a substantial
    boarding party.
Aerounkhu Packet:
  category: Ship
  page: AoCS 238
  aliases:
    - Aerounkhu
  text: >
    **600 tons  J1 M1**
    
    This merchant vessel is designed to
    transport both passengers and cargo, and
    is well armed to defend against would-be
    raiders. The Aerounkhu is primarily used
    as a passenger liner with the cargo space
    allocated to luggage storage and supplies.
    
    The Aerounkhu typically has a standard crew
    of eight, with many of the crew also serving
    as gunners in the event of corsair attack.
Leklun Corvette:
  category: Ship
  page: AoCS 240
  aliases:
    - Leklun
  text: >
    **800 tons  J4 M4**
    
    Using an 800-ton hull, the Leklun is
    commonly used by Vargr military forces
    for patrols and fighting corsair raiders.
    Some variants sacrifice the fighters for a
    G/Carrier, allowing a larger complement of
    troops to be deployed in a single action.
    While the smallest of true warships, the
    Leklun is nonetheless potent enough
    against raider vessels and when combined
    into squadrons, the corvette can cause
    problems for larger ships.
