    Also called a safety net, this failsafe system
    uses electric fields to counter gravity when falling. While the system
    is not able to actually levitate heavy objects, it will slow down a fall
    enough that the user can land safely if the gravitational force is not
    too high (less than 50 meters in 1 g). Reduce the distance of longer
    falls by 50 meters when calculating damage. Generating these electric
    fields consumes a lot of energy, so the net is only good for one
    use before it must be recharged, taking 4 hours.

    This rope's fibers can be controlled electronically:
    making it move in a snakelike fashion, stiffen up, and wrap around
    objects. It comes in a 50-meter length capable of supporting 250 kg.
    An e-rope can be cut by inflicting 20 points of damage.

    Used as a last-resort life raft on spaceships, an
    emergency bubble is made of advanced smart materials and comes in
    a large but portable package that can be quickly inflated around you
    in 1 action turn, usually inside an airlock. The bubble has a 5-meter
    diameter and can comfortably accommodate 4 people for 1 week. It
    maintains 1 atmosphere of pressure in a vacuum, protects the inhabitants
    from temperatures ranging from –175 to 140 C, and provides
    light and breathable air. A built-in autocook ▶343 provides food and
    liquids. It features a simple airlock, carries an emergency distress
    beacon, and can be transparent, opaque, or polarized. It is powered
    by a nuclear battery and includes comfortable inflatable furniture.
    This bubble can also be partially inflated as a dome and staked down
    to a surface to serve as an emergency shelter on asteroids or other
    surfaced environments.

    This pack self-unfolds in 3 action turns into a
    pressurized shelter for up to 4 medium-sized people plus gear. A
    built-in breather will convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
    (if any) indefinitely. It also packs itself.

    When activated, this worn harness fires out up
    to 6 anchoring cables with a length of 10 meters. These cables spike
    into ice, dirt, or rock, or use grip pads to adhere to an appropriate
    surface. This prevents you from drifting into space, accidentally
    kicking off with terminal velocity, or falling off a cliff face. The
    device’s ALI targets and deploys anchors, and can be instructed to
    do so under certain conditions.

    Spindles are wound lengths of thin (0.2 millimeters)
    but super-strong fullerene cable. It can extend 250 meters of cable
    capable of supporting 5,000 kilograms of weight at 1 g. The spindle
    also contains a specialized fabber that can manufacture more cable
    and extend it indefinitely, at a rate of 1 meter per minute, as long
    as it is fed with raw materials. The spindle can cut the cables it
    produces at any length. If fixed in place with built-in grip pads, it
    can also retract the cable at a rate of 50 meters per action turn, or
    re-absorb cables at the rate of 5 meters per minute. Spindle cables
    can be cut by inflicting 30 points of damage.

    This device attaches to a spindle and transforms
    it into a highly effective climbing device. The spindle climber has
    two functions. First, it attaches hardened tips to the spindle’s cable
    and fires it at high speed, up to 50 meters, with sufficient force to
    imbed the tip into almost any sufficiently durable surface (if used as
    a weapon, it inflicts DV 2d10). Second, the spindle climber can pull
    itself and up to 250 kg up the cable at a speed of 12 meters per turn.
