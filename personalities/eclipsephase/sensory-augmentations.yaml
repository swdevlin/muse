    The morph’s eyes/visual sensors are situated for a 360-degree field
    of  vision.

    **Ware**: BCH  **Min/1**
Anti-Glare:
  page: 318
  text: >
    This mod eliminates penalties for glare. If you have enhanced vision, this
    works for all wavelengths you can perceive.

    **Ware**: CH  **Min/1**
Chem Sniffer:
  page: 318
  text: >
    This sensor detects molecules in the air and analyzes their
    chemical  composition, using Know: Chemistry 60. It can determine the
    presence of explosives, firearms, and gases — including toxins and other
    fumes.

    **Ware**: CH  **Mod/2**
Direction Sense:
  page: 318
  text: >
    You acquire an innate sense of direction and distance using
    advanced  inertial navigation. You can identify north, spinward, etc., keep
    track  of that direction, and know approximately how far you’ve come.
    You  receive a +10 modifier to navigation-based Survival Tests and
    other  skills for figuring out complex directions, reading maps,
    remembering  routes, and retracing paths you’ve taken. Since it is trivial
    to use  the mesh for positioning, this augmentation is primarily used
    by  gatecrashers.

    **Ware**: BCH  **Min/1**
Electrical Sense:
  page: 318
  text: >
    You can sense electric fields. Within 5 meters, you can tell if a device is
    on or off and can detect the precise location of electrical wiring
    and  power supplies behind a wall or inside a device.

    **Ware**: CH  **Min/1**
Enhanced Hearing:
  page: 318
  text: >
    The morph’s ears can hear both higher and lower frequency sounds — the range
    of sounds they can hear is twice that of normal human ears (Senses
    and  Sensors). Your hearing is also more sensitive, allowing you to hear
    sounds  as if you are 5 times closer. Apply a +10 to hearing-based Perceive
    Tests.

    **Ware**: BCH  **Min/1**
Enhanced Vision:
  page: 318
  text: >
    The morph’s eyes have tetrachromatic vision capable of exceptional
    color  differentiation. These eyes can also see the electromagnetic spectrum
    from  terahertz wave frequencies to gamma rays, enabling them to see a total
    of  several dozen colors, instead of the seven ordinary human eyes
    can  perceive (Senses and Sensors). In addition, these eyes have a variable
    focus  equivalent to 5 power magnifiers or binoculars. You can also
    selectively  filter what frequencies you perceive to avoid minor
    distractions on those  wavelengths. This augmentation provides a +10
    modifier to all Perceive Tests  involving vision.

    **Ware**: BCH  **Mod/2**
Lidar:
  page: 318
  text: >
    This sensor scans the area with laser light and measures the reflections to
    judge range, speed, and image the target (Senses and Sensors). Lidar lasers
    are visible to enhanced vision, and are considered rude to continually emit
    in certain company.

    **Ware**: H  **Min/1**
Nanoscopic Vision:
  page: 318
  text: >
    The shell’s visual sensors can focus like a microscope, using
    advanced  superlens techniques to beat the optical diffraction limit and
    image  objects as small as a nanometer. This allows the character to view
    and  analyze objects as small as blood cells and even individual
    nanobots.  The synthmorph must stay steady to view objects at this scale,
    and the  range is quite limited (less than a meter).

    **Ware**: H  **Mod/2**
Oracles:
  page: 318
  text: >
    This neural macrosensing processor helps you pay attention to sensory input
    you are not focusing on, alerting you to important things you
    might  otherwise overlook. Oracles provide a +10 bonus to Perceive and
    negate the distraction modifier for Perceive Tests.

    **Ware**: CHM  **Mod/2**
Polarization Vision:
  page: 318
  text: >
    You can perceive polarized light, which reveals characteristics such
    as  contrast and patterns. This allows you to negate modifiers for
    camouflage  (such as from chameleon skin or smart clothes).

    **Ware**: H  **Min/1**
Radar:
  page: 318
  text: >
    This sensor system bounces radio or microwaves off targets and measures the
    reflected waves to judge size, composition, and motion (Senses and Sensors).

    **Ware**: H  **Min/1**
Radiation Sense:
  page: 318
  text: >
    You can sense the presence and approximate source of all forms of
    dangerous  radiation, including neutrons, charged particles, and cosmic
    rays.

    **Ware**: CH  **Min/1**
Sonar:
  page: 318
  text: >
    You possess echolocation like a bat or dolphin. You bounce
    ultrasonic  pulses off your surroundings and measure the echoes to build an
    image of the environment (Senses and Sensors). This augmentation works in
    both air  and water, out to a range of 20 (air) or 100 (water) meters.

    **Ware**: BCH  **Min/1**
T-Ray Emitter:
  aliases:
    - tray emitter
  page: 318
  text: >
    Mounted under the skin of the user’s forehead, this implant
    generates  low-powered beams of terahertz radiation (t-rays). Characters
    with  enhanced vision can use reflected t-rays to see effectively see
    through  walls and other materials (Senses and Sensors). This implant allows
    the  user to see using reflected t-rays for 20 meters in a normal
    atmosphere  and for 100 meters in vacuum.
