    This mod eliminates penalties for glare. If you have enhanced vision, this
    works for all wavelengths you can perceive.

chem sniffer:
  title: Chem Sniffer
  page: 318
  text: >
    This sensor detects molecules in the air and analyzes their chemical 
    composition, using Know: Chemistry 60. It can determine the presence
    of explosives, firearms, and gases — including toxins and other fumes.

    **Ware**: CH  **Mod/2**
direction sense:
  title: Direction Sense
  page: 318
  text: >
    You acquire an innate sense of direction and distance using advanced 
    inertial navigation. You can identify north, spinward, etc., keep track 
    of that direction, and know approximately how far you’ve come. You 
    receive a +10 modifier to navigation-based Survival Tests and other 
    skills for figuring out complex directions, reading maps, remembering 
    routes, and retracing paths you’ve taken. Since it is trivial to use 
    the mesh for positioning, this augmentation is primarily used by 
    gatecrashers.
    
    **Ware**: BCH  **Min/1**
electrical sense:
  title: Electrical Sense
  page: 318
  text: >
    You can sense electric fields. Within 5 meters, you can tell if a device
    is on or off and can detect the precise location of electrical wiring and 
    power supplies behind a wall or inside a device.
    
    **Ware**: CH  **Min/1**
enhanced hearing:
  title: Enhanced Hearing
  page: 318
  text: >
    The morph’s ears can hear both higher and lower frequency sounds — the range
    of sounds they can hear is twice that of normal human ears (Senses and 
    Sensors). Your hearing is also more sensitive, allowing you to hear sounds 
    as if you are 5 times closer. Apply a +10 to hearing-based Perceive Tests.
    
    **Ware**: BCH  **Min/1**
Enhanced Smell:
  title: Enhanced Vision
  page: 318
  text: >
    The morph’s sense of smell is equal to that of a bloodhound. You can 
    identify both chemicals and individuals by smell and can track people and
    chemically reactive objects by odor as long as the trail was made within the
    last several hours and has not been obscured. Apply a +10 to smell-based 
    Perceive Tests. You can also gain a general sense of the emotions and health
    of biological characters within point-blank range (+10 to Kinesics Tests).
    
    **Ware**: BCH  **Min/1**
enhanced vision:
  title: Enhanced Vision
  page: 318
  text: >
    The morph’s eyes have tetrachromatic vision capable of exceptional color 
    differentiation. These eyes can also see the electromagnetic spectrum from 
    terahertz wave frequencies to gamma rays, enabling them to see a total of 
    several dozen colors, instead of the seven ordinary human eyes can 
    perceive (Senses and Sensors). In addition, these eyes have a variable focus 
    equivalent to 5 power magnifiers or binoculars. You can also selectively 
    filter what frequencies you perceive to avoid minor distractions on those 
    wavelengths. This augmentation provides a +10 modifier to all Perceive Tests 
    involving vision.
    
    **Ware**: BCH  **Mod/2**
lidar:
  title: Lidar
  page: 318
  text: >
    This sensor scans the area with laser light and measures the reflections to
    judge range, speed, and image the target (Senses and Sensors). Lidar lasers
    are visible to enhanced vision, and are considered rude to continually emit
    in certain company.
    
    **Ware**: H  **Min/1**
nanoscopic vision:
  title: Nanoscopic Vision
  page: 318
  text: >
    The shell’s visual sensors can focus like a microscope, using advanced 
    superlens techniques to beat the optical diffraction limit and image 
    objects as small as a nanometer. This allows the character to view and 
    analyze objects as small as blood cells and even individual nanobots. 
    The synthmorph must stay steady to view objects at this scale, and the 
    range is quite limited (less than a meter).
    
    **Ware**: H  **Mod/2**
oracles:
  title: Oracles
  page: 318
  text: >
    This neural macrosensing processor helps you pay attention to sensory input
    you are not focusing on, alerting you to important things you might 
    otherwise overlook. Oracles provide a +10 bonus to Perceive and negate the
    distraction modifier for Perceive Tests.
    
    **Ware**: CHM  **Mod/2**
polarization vision:
  title: Polarization Vision
  page: 318
  text: >
    You can perceive polarized light, which reveals characteristics such as 
    contrast and patterns. This allows you to negate modifiers for camouflage 
    (such as from chameleon skin or smart clothes).
    
    **Ware**: H  **Min/1**
radar:
  title: Radar
  page: 318
  text: >
    This sensor system bounces radio or microwaves off targets and measures the
    reflected waves to judge size, composition, and motion (Senses and Sensors).
    
    **Ware**: H  **Min/1**
radiation sense:
  title: Radiation Sense
  page: 318
  text: >
    You can sense the presence and approximate source of all forms of dangerous 
    radiation, including neutrons, charged particles, and cosmic rays.
    
    **Ware**: CH  **Min/1**
sonar:
  title: Sonar
  page: 318
  text: >
    You possess echolocation like a bat or dolphin. You bounce ultrasonic 
    pulses off your surroundings and measure the echoes to build an image of
    the environment (Senses and Sensors). This augmentation works in both air 
    and water, out to a range of 20 (air) or 100 (water) meters.
    
    **Ware**: BCH  **Min/1**
t-ray emitter:
  title: T-Ray Emitter
  aliases:
    - tray emitter
  page: 318
  text: >
    Mounted under the skin of the user’s forehead, this implant generates 
    low-powered beams of terahertz radiation (t-rays). Characters with 
    enhanced vision can use reflected t-rays to see effectively see through 
    walls and other materials (Senses and Sensors). This implant allows the 
    user to see using reflected t-rays for 20 meters in a normal atmosphere 
    and for 100 meters in vacuum.
