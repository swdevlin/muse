    This collection of tools is useful for salvage ops, breaking down wrecks, or
    dissembling anything from a habitat room to a vehicle or synthmorph. They
    include plasma torches, laser cutters, pneumatic jaws, and smart-material
    tools like spanners and wrenches that can be adapted to a wide array of
    connections and fittings. Together, these tools are medium sized, usually
    ported by robomule.

Superthermite Charges:

    These powerful and highly stable demolition charges are made from a
    combination of nanometals and metal oxides. A single charge can be used to
    create an explosive blast inflicting DV 6d10 + 10 [43] when set with
    Hardware: Demolitions. A charge can be shaped with a successful Hardware:
    Demolitions Test, focusing the blast in a particular 90-degree direction
    (for example, to blow through a door). This triples the damage of the blast
    in the focused direction; in all other directions, the damage is reduced to
    1/3rd. Multiple charges apply a cumulative effect.

    **Maj/R/3 (per 5 charges)**
