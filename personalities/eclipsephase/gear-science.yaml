    If the event you must interact with ancient
    technology — perhaps even a still-functioning alien relic — the adaptive
    interface features smart-material connectors that can connect to
    almost any conceivable piece of technology. It is also equipped with
    nano-probe sensors that can analyze the device’s structure and map
    out its internal functions. The interface’s ALI is equipped with Know:
    Computer Science, Know: Electrical Engineering, Know: Xenodata,
    and Interface skills at 60, as well as Infosec and Program at 40.
    Connecting to and analyzing relics is a task action with a timeframe
    of 1 hour, possibly longer (GM discretion). This interface severs
    mesh connections when analyzing unknown devices, so as not to
    unwittingly spread infections. It is not compatible with biological
    technology or nanotech more advanced than transhumanity’s.

    This small handheld device contains numerous
    sensors for analyzing both organic and inorganic compounds
    in liquid, gaseous, and solid form. It performs material analysis
    using different methods of spectrometry, chromatography, and
    biochemical testing, comparing results to a built-in database. Using
    a pocket lab you could test soil fertility, identify clean water, detect
    hazardous emissions, discover traces of life, pinpoint contaminants,
    determine the presence of explosives or firearms, identify strange
    substances, and so on. It operates with Know: Chemistry 60.

    These very small data storage units contain
    impressive archives related to a particular subject (equivalent to one
    Know skill). They allow you to make Research Tests on that subject
    even when isolated from the mesh.

    This capsule container is designed to
    hold samples of any sort (chemical, biological, etc.) in near stasis.
    It can be programmed to reproduce whatever conditions the user
    specifies, from cryogenic freezing to extreme heat, or even vacuum
    or high-pressure atmosphere. The containers are also encased in a
    superconductive wire mesh that acts as a faraday cage and blocks
    mesh and radio signals and similar electromagnetic radiation.
