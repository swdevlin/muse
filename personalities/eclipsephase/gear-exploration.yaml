    Named for the cobalt shade in which they were originally
    manufactured, blue boxes are small-sized pandora gate control
    devices. They must be physically attached to a gate to control it; this
    requires a Hardware: Electronics task action at –10 with a timeframe
    of 1 hour. Blue boxes have built-in self-destruct mechanisms, so that
    you can destroy the device in the event it might fall into alien hands.

    This medium-sized portable rocket extends
    struts, aims itself, and launches into a low polar orbit on any planet
    with gravity below 2 g. Over a 1–2 day period, it uses a variety of
    sensors (radar, visual, infrared, mass, spectrographic) to map the
    planet and beam this information back. The maps are low resolution,
    showing nothing less than 100 meters across, but it will identify
    large masses, cities, lights on the planet’s dark side, atmospheric
    conditions, and data on the planet’s rotation and gravity.

    These small-sized missiles are easy to set up and
    launch from a disposable tube. They map the area in a 5-kilometer
    radius from their launch point, or out to 10 kilometers in a specified
    direction, in 20 minutes. Carrying visual, infrared, radar, and
    lidar sensors, and flying at an altitude of 100 meters, they can map
    terrain, locate structures, identify features of interest, and search for
    anything you specify with a Perceive 60. They transmit their sensor
    and telemetry data in real-time.
