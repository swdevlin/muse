    Vacsuits are a requirement in sealed habitats and spacecraft. They come in a
    variety of forms, from newer smart-fabric to older, retro models, both in
    light and standard designs.

    In a breathable atmosphere, modern vacsuits are loose smartfabric garments that can be worn as ordinary clothing and easily put on or taken off. When activated — either manually or automatically if the suit detects a loss of air pressure — the suit becomes skin-tight and resistant to vacuum over 3 action turns. The hood stiffens and transforms into a transparent helmet.

    Older vacsuit models lack the smart fabrics and are made of stiffer and bulkier materials. Donning one is a REF Check task action with a timeframe of 1 minute (20 action turns). Quick-release functions allow them to be removed in 3 action turns.

    Unless specifically noted, assume characters have newer models; older dumb-fabric designs are typically kept around as backups in older habitats and ships.

    Both smart-fabric and legacy light vacsuit models are ideal for less harsh
    environments such as Mars, the Venusian clouds, or exoplanets with moderate
    but unbreathable atmospheres. Their rebreathers provide 8 hours of air. All
    models include a headlight, an ecto, and atmospheric sensors. They protect
    you from temperatures from −75 to 100 °C. These vacuum suits
    instantly  self-seal breaches unless more than 20 points of damage are
    inflicted at once.

    Made from thicker and more durable materials, standard vacsuits provide 48
    hours of air and incorporate an autocook capable of recycling all wastes and
    producing food and water indefinitely. Each suit is equipped with an ecto, a
    radio booster, specs, and atmospheric sensors. These suits protect you from
    temperatures from −175 to 140 °C. They instantly seal any hole unless more
    than 30 points of damage are inflicted at once.
