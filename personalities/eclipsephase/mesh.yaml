    The most heavily secure systems are air-gapped â€” physically separated from
    the mesh. They may be hardwired, lacking wireless transceivers, or enclosed
    within radio-proof barriers. The only way to access such systems is
    physically, either directly plugging in, defeating the radio-blocking
    enclosure, or somehow attaching a wireless transceiver to the system.
