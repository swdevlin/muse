Synthmorphs:
  parent: morphs
  text: >
    Most synthmorph designs were originally intended to be robots, piloted by
    ALIs. Robot forms are optimized to suit their function, and so a wide
    variety of body plans exist. Robots designed to interact with transhumans
    often have biped or quadruped walker frames, to better navigate transhuman
    dwellings and spaces, but were often distinctly non-human in appearance.
    Many feature a sort of symbolic “face,” to give transhumans something to
    look at and interact with, but these were rarely realistic, so as to avoid
    uncanny-valley creepiness.

    Since the Fall, more synthmorphs have been designed specifically for transhuman egos, as they are cheaper and quicker to make than biomorphs. Without specialized robotic functions in mind, many of these synthmorph designs feature anthropomorphic frames (androids and gynoids) specifically tailored for egos used to human forms, including heads and distinctive (though still non-realistic) faces. As transhumanity grows accustomed to synthmorphs and more creative, however, innovative and unusual synthmorph designs become more common-place.

Arachnoid:

  text: >
    Arachnoid shells mimic the shapes of spiders, termites, ants, beetles, and
    other arthropods. Three or four sets of pneumatic limbs are capable of
    rotating around their meter-long torso, and an additional set of manipulator
    arms near the head enables fine manipulation and tool use. Arachnoids move
    by walking, hopping, extending omnidirectional mini-wheels for skating
    movement, or by retracting their limbs and maneuvering with vectored-air
    thrusters in microgravity.

    Cases are mass-produced robotic shells, an affordable resleeving option for
    the poor, though of notoriously poor quality. They are available in many
    varieties to suit a client’s taste. Most case morphs are anthropomorphic,
    with a thin framework body standing just shorter than an average human.

Dragonfly:

    The dragonfly takes the shape of a meter long flexible shell with eight
    wings, four manipulator limbs, and a prehensile tail. Capable of near-silent
    flight in Earth gravity, dragonfly bots fare even better in microgravity.
    Their wings operate independently and can rotate, allowing for graceful
    maneuvering, hovering, and tight turns.

Galatea:

    This high-end shell was designed to increase the appeal and social
    acceptance of synthmorphs. Galateas look expensive and their mental
    architecture is crafted to enhance the wearer’s personality and charm.
    Though many media icons have embraced this morph’s novelty, biochauvinists
    still view it as a monstrosity.

Reaper:

    The reaper is a combat morph in the form of an armored disc, so that it can
    turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. Four legs/manipulating arms and
    four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. It uses vector-thrust nozzles
    to maneuver in microgravity and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for
    fast movement over distance. Reapers are infamous due to military sims and
    Fall XPs; bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows if
    not get you arrested.

    Slitheroid shells take the form of a humanoid torso with retractable arms
    atop a 2-meter-long segmented metallic snake. Slitheroids use lateral
    undulation to move, though they can also pull themselves along by their arms
    or coil, twist, and roll their bodies like a ball or hoop.

Spare:

    Spares are small, portable shells designed as a temporary replacement sleeve
    should your primary morph be killed/destroyed. They are common gear for
    gatecrashing missions. Packed as a flat 15-centimeter disc, when activated
    they pop into a six-limbed spherical shape. Just plug your original cortical
    stack in and you are ready to go. Built-in stress-management systems help
    survivors handle the trauma of their recent death.

Steel Morph:

    Like the galatea, this upscale shell was designed to counter biochauvinist
    attitudes and make synthmorphs more appealing. Where the galatea is
    optimized for social interaction, steel morphs provide enhanced physical
    capabilities for both work and recreation.

Swarmanoid:

    Swarmanoids are swarms composed of hundreds of insect-sized microbots. Each
    individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or
    using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The cyberbrain, cortical stack, and
    sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can
    “meld” together into various loose shapes, it is incapable of physical tasks
    like grabbing, lifting, or holding. Individual bots are linked by radio and
    laser and are quite capable of interfacing with electronics. Swarmanoids
    follow swarm rules ▶344.

Synths:

    Synths are even more humanoid than cases and of better quality. They are
    commonly deployed for labor-intensive tasks in environments not suited for
    biomorphs or for people who need a body quickly and cheaply or simply on a
    transient basis. Most designs are anthropomorphic, though various
    alternatives exist, including some based on uplift physiology.
