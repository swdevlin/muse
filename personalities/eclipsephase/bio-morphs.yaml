    Biomorphs are fully biological sleeves (often genetically modified and
    equipped with implants), birthed naturally or from an exowomb, and grown to
    adulthood either naturally or at a slightly accelerated rate.

    Bouncers are genetically adapted for microgravity. Their legs are more
    limber and their feet can grasp as well as their hands. They can tolerate
    the cold temperatures of beehive tunnels and have an oxygen reserve in case
    they are exposed to vacuum. Bouncers are very common in the outer system and
    zero-g habitats.

    Exalts are the common, non-specialized “enhanced human” model. They are
    genetically upgraded to make them healthier, smarter, and more attractive
    (based on everevolving beauty standards). A modified metabolism keeps them
    fit and athletic for the duration of an extended lifespan.

    Flats are baseline unmodified humans, born with all of the natural defects,
    hereditary diseases, and other genetic mutations that evolution so lovingly
    applies. Flats are increasingly rare outside bioconservative enclaves — most
    died off with the rest of humanity during the Fall.

    Furies are combat morphs. These transgenic humans are upgraded for
    endurance, strength, reflexes, and capacity to handle physical trauma.
    Behavioral modifications for aggressiveness are offset by gene sequences
    promoting pack mentalities and cooperation, and they tend to be biologically
    female.

Futura:

    Futura morphs were specially crafted for the “Lost Generation” of
    accelerated-growth children. Adjusted for confidence, self-reliance, and
    adaptability, futuras were intended to help transhumanity regain its
    foothold. These programs proved disastrous and the line was discontinued,
    but some models and various spin-offs remain, viewed by some with distaste
    and others as collectibles or exotic oddities.

    Ghosts are partially designed for combat applications, but their primary

Hibernoid:

    Hibernoids are transgenic-modified humans with heavily altered sleep
    patterns and metabolic processes. Hibernoids have a decreased need for
    sleep, requiring only 1–2 hours a day on average. They can also trigger a
    form of voluntary hibernation, effectively halting their metabolism and need
    for oxygen. Hibernoids make excellent long-duration space travelers, but
    these morphs are also favored by personal aides and hypercapitalists with
    non-stop lifestyles.

    Neotenics are transhumans modified to retain a child-like form. They are
    smaller, more agile, inquisitive, and less resource-depleting, making them
    ideal for habitat living and spacecraft. Some people find neotenic sleeves
    distasteful, especially when employed in certain media and sex work
    capacities, but most are designed to be neuter-gendered.

    The remade are completely redesigned: humans 2.0. Their cardiovascular
    system is stronger, their digestive tract sanitized and restructured, and
    they have been optimized for health, intelligence, and longevity with
    numerous transgenic mods. They look close to human, but are different in
    very noticeable and sometimes eerie ways: taller, lack of hair, slightly
    larger craniums, wider eyes, smaller noses, smaller teeth, and elongated
    digits. The remade are popular with the Ultimates faction.
