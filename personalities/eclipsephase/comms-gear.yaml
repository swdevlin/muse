    Neutrino particles pass through solid matter with ease and are impossible to
    block. As a result, they make an ideal medium for communications.
    Unfortunately, they are also easy to intercept. Even a tight beam of
    neutrinos sent between two locations can be intercepted simply by placing
    another receiver behind the location the broadcaster is sending to. Neutrino
    communicators require a large power plant to power the high energy particle
    interactions required to generate the neutrino broadcast. Neutrino
    communicators usually broadcast neutrinos in all directions, though
    tight-beam transmissions are also possible. Quite often neutrino
    communications take advantage of quantum farcasting for security.
