    depending on need. Roles include: $list

    Firewall’s broad interests require in-depth research capabilities, and these are carried out or supervised by
    crows. Crows are our expert scientists and researchers specializing in various fields. Some of the most brilliant
    individuals in transhumanity work as crows, offering insights into xenobiology, memetics, physics, applied
    mathematics, economics, nanoweaponry, and other fields of knowledge. Crows work closely with scanners to assess
    threats or research items or data unearthed during Firewall operations. Firewall’s black laboratories and
    research facilities are maintained by our crows, but much of our scientific access comes from crows misappropriating
    facility use and equipment from their civilian careers.

eraser:

    The most dangerous operations are carried out or overseen by erasers. Typically, Firewall prefers to conduct its
    work with a minimum of collateral damage and attention, but when this is not desirable, or has been made
    impossible in the wake of a mission gone wrong, erasers are called in to address a threat with a maximal response.
    Erasers are not deployed casually, they represent a final line of response only used in the most dire of
    circumstances. Most Firewall members will never require the services of an eraser or even be in the presence of one
    during the course of their field operations. Erasers tend to work in teams with heavy firepower and tricked-out
    combat morphs. A few erasers work solo; these are sometimes deployed as assassins or saboteurs.

    The actions of sentinels and erasers may require the attention of a filter. Where erasers mop up the opposition,
    filters are the ones who make the whole mess go away. These individuals specialize in public-relations
    manipulation and will work to pin the blame for a disastrous operation on an appropriate accident, external agency,
    hypercorp, or individual. Filters are also sometimes called upon to assist operations in progress when they
    require public misdirection or spin control to fulfil their objectives.

register:

    Registers are one of the most critical but invisible of proxy roles. These individuals are talented financiers
    and fixers, capable of finding credits to finance ongoing operations and research and making sure our sentinels
    in the field are equipped. As an unofficial network, Firewall receives no official support or endowments. It
    falls to the registers to find funding through investment, creative financing, and even theft. Every server makes
    use of several registers without whom the entire organization would vanish overnight. Registers also use their
    rep network ties to pull in favors for servers and sentinel cells. In these regards, they sometimes call on the
    other proxies and sentinels to help repay favors or earn good karma.
router:

    A router is charged with initiating and managing an operation. A router will assess all of the available intel,
    determine which cell is best able to respond to the threat, coordinate with other proxies to prepare their
    necessary support (morphs, lines of credit, cover stories, etc), and then activate the cell. Routers then monitor
    the cell's activities and provide support as necessary or possible. As the mission coordinators, routers have one
    of the most difficult, thankless, and critical jobs in Firewall.
scanner:
  title: Scanner

    Scanners are expert data analysts and researchers. A server’s
    scanners are responsible for gathering information of interest to
    Firewall, analyzing it, and then making a threat analysis. Scanners
    rely on sophisticated search algorithms and ALIs to monitor particular
    channels, both public and private. A scanner is constantly
    assessing a broad range of data looking for anomalous items or
    events that may relate to an ongoing case or operations. Scanners
    are the members of a server most likely to initiate an operation.
    Tasked with gathering information from the entire Solar System
    and filtering it for items of interest to Firewall places a heavy
    burden on our scanners; if something crucial gets overlooked, they
    get the blame.

server:

    Each cell is part of a server. Servers are collections of cells that share a common interest or overarching
    objective. Servers often have a focus or specialization: the observation and identification of threats in a
    specific region, infiltration of hypercorps suspected of meddling with ASI, countering a known group of exhumans,
    and so forth. Many are dedicated to ongoing research projects or action task forces, known as cases or
    operations respectively. An individual cell within a server may further specialize in necessary sub-tasks.
vector:
  title: Vector
  parent: firewall roles
  page: 172

    Vectors are those proxies specializing in the broad array of skills we loosely refer to as “hacking.” Primarily a
    support role, vectors are responsible for digital intrusion, information security, data manipulation,
    infrastructure sabotage, and social engineering. Vectors rarely deploy to the field, but often provide remote
    overwatch on operations in real-time when necessary. Most often vectors spend their time assessing potential
    targets, testing their existing assets, or helping clean up loose ends from operations. During a field operation,
    your assigned vector is likely to be the only dedicated support you can expect to receive.
