    Pods (a colloquialism derived from “pod people”) were originally designed as
    biological androids. Their parts are vat-grown separately using
    accelerated-growth processes and assembled with a number of cybernetic
    system “short-cuts;” this entire process producing a functional body in a
    fraction of the time it takes to clone a standard biomorph. Cyberbrains
    replace their undeveloped gray matter. The first generations of pods were
    operated by ALIs and primarily used in service industries where a biological
    aesthetic was preferred to robots, in hazardous labor industries, and for
    sex work. They were visually distinguished from normal humans by stylized
    seamlined patterns in their skin, a designation that remains common today.
    In the wake of the Fall and the subsequent demand for more biomorphs, pods
    are now commonly sleeved by transhumans, especially indentures, but they
    still often suffer a classist stigma. Pods lack reproductive functions and
    are usually neuter. Non-human pods are increasingly common.

Novacrab:

    Bioengineered from coconut crab and spider crab stock and grown to a larger
    (human) size, novacrabs are ideal for hazardous work environments as well as
    vacworker, police, or bodyguard duties. They climb and handle microgravity
    well and can withstand a wide range of atmospheric pressure (and sudden
    pressure changes) from vacuum to deep sea. They are equipped with ten
    2-meter long legs, massive claws, chitinous armor, compound eyes (with
    human-equivalent image resolution), gills, dexterous manipulatory digits on
    their fifth set of limbs, and transgenic vocal cords.

Pleasure Pod:

    Pleasure pods are faux humans intended for intimate entertainment purposes
    and indulgent hedonism. Their biology includes extra nerve clusters in their
    erogenous zones, fine motor control over certain muscle groups, enhanced
    pheromones, sanitized metabolisms, and the capability to purr. They are
    capable of switching between multiple sex configurations and are often
    enhanced in other areas.

Security Pod:

    Security pods were originally manufactured as mass-produced AI-operated
    soldiers for joint peacekeeping missions and enclave border/security roles.
    Many were co-opted by the TITANs during the Fall, so they fell out of favor
    for many years, but a demand for cheap mercenary morphs has revived
    interest.

Shaper:

  parent: podmorphs

    Shapers are designed for infiltration and disguise. They lack the seamlines
    common to pods and incorporate ware that allows them to alter their
    appearance. Favored by spies and criminals, they are illegal in many
    habitats.
