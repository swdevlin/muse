    Characteristics measure a character's most basic abilities: how strong, 
    dexterous, educated or intelligent they are. Characteristic scores 
    influence almost everything your character does. Stronger characters 
    can lift greater weights, more dexterous characters have better balance, 
    and so forth.
    
    Characters have six abilities: $list. Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance 
    are called physical abilities, whereas Intelligence, Education, and 
    Social Standing are loosely termed mental abilities. Each above-average 
    ability score provides a bonus on certain die rolls; while below average 
    abilities apply a penalty to some die rolls.
