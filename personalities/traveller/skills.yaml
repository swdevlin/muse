Skills:
  page: 56
  text: >
    If a Traveller has no level in a skill at all (Skill -), then they are
    untrained and will suffer DM-3 when trying to use that skill.


    If a Traveller has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then they are competent in using that skill, but probably has had little experience in actually using it. The Traveller does not get any bonus from their skill ranks when using that skill, but at least avoids the penalty for being untrained.


    If a Traveller has one or more levels in a skill (Skill 1, Skill 2, and so on etc.) then they are trained in that skill. Each level represents several years of experience using that skill, and grants DM+1 per level to all skill checks using that skill. A Traveller with level 2-3 in a skill is a skilled professional in that field. A Traveller with level 4 or 5 is probably both well-respected and well-known in their field.


    To make a check, the Traveller rolls 2D and includes any appropriate Dice Modifiers (DM). If the total is 8 or more, the Traveller succeeds. For a skill check, the Traveller adds both their skill level and an appropriate characteristic DM.

  aliases:
    - difficulty

    **Simple** tasks are trivial for everyone. A Simple task might be requesting
    weather data from a standard tourist computer system or sneaking up on a
    drugged guard. Simple tasks succeed on a **2** or more.

    **Easy** tasks are trivial for a trained professional, and simple for an amateur. An Easy task might be hiking cross-country for a few hours or activating an unfamiliar device that has a clear and simple interface. Easy tasks succeed on a **4** or more.

    A **Routine** task is trivial for a trained professional, and relatively easy even for an amateur. A Routine task might be hitting a prone victim in melee or landing a ship in optimum conditions with computer assistance. Routine tasks succeed on a **6** or more.

    An **Average** task is a moderate obstacle to a trained professional. An Average task might be shooting a gun accurately at range or repairing a damaged circuit board. Average tasks succeed on an **8** or more.

    A **Difficult** task is difficult even for a trained professional. Examples might be making an accurate shot in the middle of a ferocious storm or hacking into a secure computer network. Difficult tasks succeed on a **10** or more.

    Very Difficult tasks are hard for a trained professional, and nearly impossible for an amateur. They succeed on a **12** or more.

    Formidable tasks are exceptionally hard, such as performing surgery on an unknown alien of radically different biology or hacking a military-grade computer network. Formidable tasks succeed on a **14** or more.

Jack-of-All-Trades:
  parent: skills
  page: 66
  text: >
    The Jack-of-All-Trades skill works differently to other skills. It reduces
    the unskilled penalty a Traveller receives for not having the appropriate
    skill by one for every level of Jack-of-All-Trades. For example, if a
    Traveller does not have the Pilot skill, he suffers DM-3 to all Pilot
    checks. If that Traveller has Jack-of-All-Trades 2, then the penalty is
    reduced by 2 to DM-1. With  Jack-of-All-Trades 3, a Traveller can totally
    negate the penalty for being unskilled.


    There is no benefit for having Jack-of-All-Trades 0 or Jack-of-All-Trades 4 or more.
Language:
  parent: skills
  page: 66
  text: >
    There are numerous different Language specialities, each one covering

    computer translator programs mean Language skills are not always needed on
    other worlds. Having Language 0 implies the Traveller has a smattering of
    simple phrases in several languages.

    ⦁ *Ordering a Meal, Asking for Basic Directions*: Routine (6+) Language check (1D seconds, EDU).

    – some advanced equipment and spacecraft components require the Engineer
    skill. Unlike the narrower and more focussed Engineer or Science skills,
    Mechanic does not allow a Traveller to build new devices or alter existing
    ones – it is purely for repairs and maintenance but covers all types of
    equipment.

Profession:
  parent: skills
  page: 68
  text: >
    A Traveller with a Profession skill is trained in producing useful goods or
    services. There are many different Profession specialities, but each one
    works the same way – the Traveller can make a Profession check to earn money
    on a planet that supports that trade. The amount of money raised is Cr250 x
    the Effect of the check per month. Unlike other skills with specialties,
    levels in the Profession skill do not grant the ability to use other
    specialties at level 0. Each specialty must be learned individually. Someone
    with a Profession skill of 0 has a general grasp of working for a living but
    little experience beyond the most menial jobs.


    There are a huge range of potential specialities for this skill, one for every possible profession in the universe. Some examples suitable to a science fiction setting are given here. Also note that on some worlds other skills, such as Animals or Computer, may be used to earn a living in the same manner as Profession skills.

    The Vacc Suit skill allows a Traveller to wear and operate spacesuits and
    environmental suits. A Traveller will rarely need to make Vacc Suit checks
    under ordinary circumstances – merely possessing the skill is enough. If the
    Traveller does not have the requisite Vacc Suit skill for the suit he is
    wearing, he suffers DM-2 to all skill checks made while wearing a suit for
    each missing level. This skill also permits the character to operate
    advanced battle armour.

    ⦁ *Performing a Systems Check on Battle Dress*: Average (8+) Vacc Suit check (1D minutes, EDU).
