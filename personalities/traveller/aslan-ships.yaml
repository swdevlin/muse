    A popular design inside the Hierate, especially within the Trojan Reach, the
    little Aoa’iw is a 300-ton trader that combines a sizable cargo bay with
    space for passengers, enough firepower to serve as a raider or defend itself
    from piracy and vehicles to support a flexible mission profile. Aoa’iws are
    often owned by clans, as they are capable of  performing a wide variety of
    tasks. On the border worlds, the Aoa’iw is nicknamed the ‘pouncer’, as it
    does resemble a crouching animal from certain angles.
Halaheike-class Pocket Warship:

    This so-called ‘pocket warship’ is a 1,200-ton spacecraft used by smaller
    clans for military operations. The Halaheike is heavily armed for its size,
    with a range of missile racks, lasers and particle beams and carries a
    fighter complement of ten fighters and two launches for boarding actions and
    customs inspections. Some owners convert the cargo bay to hold troops or
    some 200 low berths (although this will put a serious strain on the power
    plant), allowing the Halaheike to serve as a troop transport.


    The design is known for maintenance issues and jump drive failures but the vessel’s main problem is that it tries to do too much in one package, requiring the most advanced Aslan technology just to function. The Halaheike might be a carrier, assault cruiser, system defence boat and troop carrier all in one but is sub-par in all those roles. Larger clans that can afford specialist vessels rarely field Halaheikes.
