    Computers in Traveller are ranked by their Processing
    score. A Computer/3, for example, has a Processing
    score of 3. This is its ability to run software.
    
    Note that the storage capacity of computers is not used
    in Traveller as, beyond TL8, the capacity of even a
    modest computer is effectively unlimited.
    
    All software has a Bandwidth score, which represents
    the processing power a computer requires in order to
    run it. At any one time, a computer can run a number of
    software packages whose combined Bandwidth does
    not exceed its Processing score.
    
    For example, a Computer/3 could run Translator/1 and
    Security/2 simultaneously, but if the Traveller using
    it then wanted to run Intelligent Interface (which has
    Bandwidth 1) then they would have to swap it out with
    one of the existing software packages.
    
    A Traveller can use any high-Bandwidth software
    at a lower Bandwidth, to a minimum of the lowest
    Bandwidth shown. For example, a Traveller could run
    Intrusion/3 on a Computer/1 but it would only function
    as Intrusion/1.
    
    A computer with Processing 0 can only run one
    software package of Bandwidth 0 at a time.
    Note that Processing does not limit how much software
    a computer can store and have ready to use, just how
    many software packages can be active and useable at
    any one time.
    
    A computer must be of a TL equal to or greater than
    that of the software in order to be able to run it,
    regardless of available Bandwidth.
    
    Software packages of more than Bandwidth 1 cannot
    be copied easily, as they require a non-trivial amount of
    bandwidth to transfer.

    The following software is available: $list
Interface:

    *Bandwidth 0  TL7*
    
    Displays data.
Intelligent Interface:

    *Bandwidth 1  TL11*
    
    Artificial intelligence allows voice control and displays data
    intelligently. Required for using Expert software.
Security:

    *Bandwidth 0-3  TL8-12*
    
    Security software packages defend against intrusion.
    Security/0 requires an Average (8+) Electronics
    (computers) check to successfully bypass.
Intrusion:

    *Bandwidth 1-4  TL10-15*
    
    Intrusion software packages aid hacking attempts, giving
    a bonus equal to their Bandwidth. Intrusion software is
    often illegal
Expert:

    *Bandwidth 1-3  TL11-13*
    
    Expert software packages mimic skills. A Traveller using
    Expert may make a skill check as if they had the skill at the
    software’s Bandwidth -1. Only INT and EDU-based checks
    can be attempted. If a Traveller already has the skill, then
    Expert grants DM+1 to their check.

    *Bandwidth 0-1  TL9-10*
    
    Translators are specialised Expert packages that only have
    Language skills. The TL9 version provides a near-real-time
    translation. The TL10 works in real-time and has a much
    better understanding of the nuances of language.
Database:

    *TL7*
    
    A database is a large store of information on a topic that
    can be searched with an Electronics (computers) check or
    using an Agent.
Agent:

    *Bandwidth 0-3  TL11-14*
    
    Agent packages have an Electronics (computers) skill
    equal to their Bandwidth and can carry out tasks assigned
    to them with a modicum of intelligence. For example, an
    Agent package might be commanded to hack into an enemy
    computer system and steal a particular data file. They are
    effectively specialised combinations of Expert Electronics
    (computers) and less capable Intellect software packages.
Intellect:

  text: >
    *Bandwidth 1-3  TL12-14*
    
    Intellect is an improved Agent, which can use Expert
    systems. For example, a robot doctor might be running
    Intellect/1 and Expert Medic/3, giving it a Medic skill of 2.
    An Intellect program can simultaneously use a number of
    skills equal to its Bandwidth.
Computer Terminal:

    This is a ‘dumb’ terminal
    with only limited processing power. It serves as an
    interface to a more powerful computer such as a ship’s
    computer or planetary network. Terminals range in size
    depending on their control method – a holographic
    display terminal can be much smaller than one with
    a physical keyboard and screen. These terminals are
    treated as Computer/0.
Portable Computer:

    A portable computer is a
    computer system with considerable processing
    power, yet able to be easily carried – in today’s world,
    this covers laptops and tablets of all sizes. It is more
    powerful than a computer terminal and can be used
    without access to a network.
Specialised Computer:
  page: 112
  text: >
    A computer can be designed
    for a specific purpose, which gives it a Processing
    Score of +1 or +2 higher for that software only. The
    navigation hand computer used by an explorer, for
    example, might be only a Computer/1 but could run the
    Navigation/3 software because it is specially designed
    for that task. A specialised computer costs 25% more
    per added rating – so, a Computer/1, Navigation/3
    portable computer costs 150% of the cost of a basic
    Computer/1.
Data Display/Recorder:

    This headpiece
    provides a continuous heads-up display for the user,
    allowing them to view computer data from any linked
    system. DD/R headsets are commonly used by starship
    crews, to access information without changing their
    primary console displays. DD/Rs can display data from
    any system, not just computers – they can display vacc
    suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity
    scanner results and so forth.
Data Wafer:
  page: 112
  text: >
    The standard medium of
    information storage in many universes is the data wafer,
    a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size of a credit
    card. The interface for a data wafer is standardised but
    the internal workings vary. A TL10 data wafer is memory
    diamond, with information encoded in structures of
    carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more exotic
    means of data storage.
Comms:

    Any computer of TL8 or more can
    act as a short-ranged comm unit or transceiver if
    specified at purchase. This does not increase the
    cost of the computer.
