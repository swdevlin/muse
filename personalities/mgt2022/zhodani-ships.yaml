Ninz-class Scout:

  aliases:

    **100 tons  J2  M2**
    
    A standard civilian exploratory vessel used
    by both commercial concerns and the
    Consulate Navy for frontier exploration and
    reconnaissance. An old and reliable design,
    this scout is oriented more towards survey
    and scientific missions and less to courier-type
    duties than its Imperial counterpart
    is. Ninz-class scouts see extensive use for
    supplemental surveys off the main axis of
    exploration within the Core Expeditions.
    Ships in naval service are named after
    former naval officers.
Yetsasl-class Courier:

  aliases:
    - Yetsasl

    **200 tons  J3  M2**
    
    The Yetsasl-class is named after a racing
    beast on Zhdant and individual ships
    often after similar creatures on other
    worlds. The courier design gives priority
    to transport of important personnel, such
    as government officials on diplomatic
    missions. The Yetsasl’s role often
    takes it outside the Consulate and it
    is the Zhodani vessel most commonly
    encountered in the Imperium. Yetsasls are
    a separate design from Ninz scouts, unlike
    the Imperial practice of using the same
    hull for both scouts and couriers; a Yetsasl
    is larger than a Ninz and contains more
    extensive staterooms and fittings.
Zdebr-class Trader:

    **400 tons  J2  M1**
    
    Individuals and small trading companies
    are the most prolific operators Zdebr-class
    traders and these ships are a common sight
    in frontier regions of the Consulate. They
    are more general-purpose vessels than
    the 400-ton subsidised merchant used in
    the Imperium, being closer in concept to
    an oversized free trader. Atypically for a
    Zhodani commercial vessel the Zdebr is
    armed, albeit lightly. Zdebr-class ships are
    named after historically famous seaports
    and caravan routes on old Zhdant.
Shianjo-class Liner:

    **900 tons  J4  M1**
    
    A passenger liner used in the core regions
    of the Consulate and along most of its main
    trade routes, the Shianjo (‘Good Journey’)
    has a reputation for its stylish interior
    design and high jump range. Nobles and
    Intendants typically occupy staterooms,
    while Proles travel in low passage unless
    they are servants or retainers. Commercial
    vessels are normally unarmed in peaceful
    Consulate space but in wartime this
    makes them easy targets for privateers and
    commerce raiders, forcing the Zhodani
    navy to provide escorts.

    **2000 tons  J4  M4**
    
    Supreme council members and their agents
    on Consular business use these fast, highly
    advanced ships. Interior fittings are notably
    luxurious, but they are unusual as they
    carry a second starship internally – a 200
    ton Yetsasl courier, used for side-trips or
    ensuring the safety of the Consul on board
    should the corvette come under attack.
