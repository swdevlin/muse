    Surveillance devices such as hidden
    microphones and tiny cameras, bugs are available
    from TL5 onwards. They rapidly miniaturise and
    become more intelligent. A TL14 bug can be no
    bigger than a dust mote. The smaller a bug, though
    the shorter its range – a bug that transmits data
    needs a much larger power supply than one that just
    records until collected.

    A commdot is a tiny microphone/speaker and transmitter,
    ranging in size between
    a few centimetres and a few millimetres across.
    A commdot is capable of interfacing with another
    communications device and relaying messages
    back and forth. Commdots have a range of only
    a few metres and are usually used as hands-free
    communicators but can also be used as improvised
    bugs or throat microphones.

    **TL 6**
    
    A mobile comm unit is a portable
    telecommunications device/computer/camera,
    ranging in size from a bulky handset to a slim watch
    or pen-like cylinder – in today’s world we call them
    mobile phones or cell phones. Larger comms have
    physical controls and screens while smaller units
    either project data and control displays onto nearby
    surfaces, have fold-out plastic screens, or connect
    to cybernetics. Comms have only short-range
    transmission and reception capabilities but most
    technologically advanced worlds will have planetwide
    comm networks allowing the user to send messages
    and access data anywhere.

    **TL 9**
    
    A transceiver is a stand-alone
    communications device, what today we would call a
    two-way radio. Unlike a mobile comm, which relies
    on the presence of an established communications
    network, a transceiver can send and receive directly
    under its own power. Most transceivers are radio or
    laser-based. Meson communicators are possible but
    generally not easily portable or available.
    To reach orbital ranges reliably, a transceiver requires
    a range of 500 kilometres.
