    an additional 2D of them into combat.

    The animal is
    a carrier of disease and will infect any creature it comes

    high precision. It can operate in complete darkness,
    although two-dimensional details (such as writing on a
    page) cannot be made out. Echolocation can operate in
    noisy environments but can be completely blocked by
    sounds operating at similar high frequencies.
