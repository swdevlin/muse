Simple Task:
  page: 60
  aliases:
    - simple
  text: >
    Simple tasks are trivial for everyone. A Simple task
    might be requesting weather data from a standard
    tourist computer system, ordering a meal in a language
    you know well or sneaking up on a drugged guard.
    Simple tasks require a **2** or more to be rolled for the
    check if, indeed, they are rolled for at all.
Easy Task:
  page: 60
  aliases:
    - easy
  text: >
    Easy tasks are trivial for a trained professional and
    simple for an amateur. An Easy task might be hiking
    cross-country for a few hours, holding a ship in
    perfectly level flight, or activating an unfamiliar device
    that has a clear and simple interface. Easy tasks
    require a **4** or more to be rolled for the check.
Routine Task:
  page: 60
  aliases:
    - Routine
  text: >
    A Routine task is trivial for a trained professional and
    relatively easy even for an amateur. A Routine task
    might be hitting a prone victim in melee, landing a
    ship in optimum conditions with computer assistance,
    translating a newspaper and so on. Routine tasks
    require a **6** or more to be rolled for the check.
Average Task:
  page: 60
  aliases:
    - Average
  text: >
    An Average task is a moderate obstacle to a trained
    professional. Shooting a gun accurately at range,
    plotting the jump calculations for a starship, repairing
    a damaged circuit board or finding a buyer for a cargo
    bay full of machine parts on an industrial world are all
    examples of Average tasks, which require the normal **8**
    or more to be rolled for the check.
Difficult Task:
  page: 60
  aliases:
    - Difficult
  text: >
    A Difficult task is tough even for a trained professional.
    Examples might be making an accurate shot in the
    middle of a ferocious storm, defending a client in court
    when they are clearly guilty, hacking into a secure
    computer network or spotting the flash of sunlight
    reflecting off a sniper’s scope. Difficult tasks require a
    **10** or more to be rolled for the check.
Very Difficult Task:
  page: 60
  aliases:
    -  Very Difficult
  text: >
    Very Difficult tasks are hard for a trained professional
    and nearly impossible for an amateur. They require a
    **12** or more to be rolled for the check.
Formidable Task:
  page: 60
  aliases:
    - Formidable
  text: >
    Formidable tasks are exceptionally hard, such as
    performing surgery on an alien of radically different
    biology, hacking a military-grade computer network,
    disarming a terrorist bomb or convincing a city of
    superstitious natives that you are a peaceful trader
    and not a demon from the outer darkness when you do
    not speak a word of their language. Formidable tasks
    require a **14** or more to be rolled for the check.
Impossible Task:
  page: 60
  aliases:
    - Impossible
  text: >
    Impossible tasks require near-miracles to pull off,
    such reconstructing alien DNA, rebuilding a worldwide
    military-grade computer network from scratch or
    flying a starship through an area of space filled with
    treacherous stellar phenomena in record-beating time.
    Impossible tasks require a **16** or more to be rolled for
    the check.
Boon:
  page: 61
  text: >
    If a Traveller has help, such as good tools, competent
    aids or other beneficial circumstances, they receive a
    Boon. This means they roll an extra dice during a check
    and discard the lowest.
Bane:
  page: 61
  text: >
    If a Traveller is hindered in a check, such as with
    poor tools, a dimly lit environment or other negative
    circumstances, they receive a Bane. This means they
    roll an extra dice during a check and discard the highest.
Effect:
  page: 61
  text: >
    The effect is how well, or poorly, the Traveller completed a task. To 
    determine this, subtract the target number from the dice roll of the
    check, including any modifiers. This margin of success (or failure) is the
    Effect that can be consulted on the Effect Results table. This is
    also used in combat to calculate damage.
    
    *For example, if a Traveller rolls a 4 and a 3 for an
    Average (8+) check, then applies DM+3 for a total of
    10, their Effect is (10 – 8) 2.*
Fatigue:
  page: 80
  text: >
    A Traveller can become fatigued in several ways:
    
    • After staying awake for a number of hours greater
    than their END + 18.
    
     • After performing heavy labour for a number of
    hours greater than their END.
    
    • After making a number of consecutive melee
    attacks greater than their END in a single combat.
    
    A fatigued Traveller suffers DM-2 to all checks until they
    rest. At the referee’s discretion, continuing exhausting
    work while already fatigued can result in the Traveller
    falling unconscious. Various drugs and treatments can
    relieve fatigue.
