    Despite advances in energy weapons and other offensive
    technologies, accelerating a small piece of metal to high
    velocity is still one of the most efficient ways of killing
    someone. Chemically propelled firearms give way to
    gyrojet (rocket bullets) and gauss (electromagnetically
    launched bullets) as technology advances.
    
    These weapons require the Gun Combat (slug) skill: $list

    Also known as gyrojet weapons,
    accelerator rifles are designed for zero-gravity
    combat. They fire tiny missiles that leave the rifle
    with minimal velocity and thus minimal recoil, then
    accelerate to high speed.

    **3D**
    
    The ultimate evolution
    of the conventional firearm, advanced combat
    rifles are the weapon of choice for many military
    units. Standard equipment includes an electronic
    battlefield sight, incorporating both light amplification
    and passive IR, visual magnification and a laser
    rangefinder, which may also be used as a target
    painting device. The weapon is also gyroscopically
    stabilised during firing. A sling is provided and
    the muzzle of the rifle includes an integral flash
    suppressor and adaptor for launching a 40mm RAM
    shoot-through grenade.

    **2D-3**
    
    A flintlock or other primitive projectile
    weapon. Unless the weapon is especially well made,
    it will have DM-1 to all attacks. Antique pistols require
    a successful Gun Combat (slug) check to reload,
    taking 2D3 Minor Actions.

    Variants of this semi-automatic pistol is
    the standard sidearm for law enforcement officers
    and criminals across the Imperium.

    Automatic rifles have a higher muzzle
    velocity and are capable of automatic fire. Sometimes
    called battle rifles.

    **2D**
    
    Body pistols are manufactured from
    plastics and cultured bone, making them very difficult
    to detect using conventional weapons scanners. Body
    pistols impose DM-4 to any Electronics (sensors)
    checks made to detect them.
Gauss Pistol:

    Gauss pistols use electromagnetic
    coils to accelerate metallic darts to hypersonic speeds.
    Gauss weapons are lightweight, efficient and deadly.

    Gauss rifles replace conventional rifles
    at TL13. Like the smaller gauss pistol, rifles fire high-velocity
    projectiles using electromagnetic rails.

    Shotguns are smoothbore weapons that
    typically fire ammunition containing multiple small
    pellets. They are most effective at short range. A
    shotgun using pellet ammunition ignores Dodge dice
    modifiers but armour gives double Protection against
    pellet attacks.

    These lightweight, low-recoil weapons
    were designed for use aboard spacecraft and in
    zero gravity.

    **3D**
    
    A short weapon capable of
    automatic fire, it puts the power of an assault rifle into
    a small package. However, it lacks a rifleâ€™s accuracy
    at range.
