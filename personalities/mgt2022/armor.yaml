    Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armour can
    be worn at a time but there are exceptions. Resolve
    damage from the outside in – damage that gets
    through the outer layer of armour is next applied to the
    inner layer.
    
    Some armours have a required skill. A Traveller suffers
    DM-1 to all checks taken in the armour per missing
    skill level. For example, a Traveller with Vacc Suit skill
    0 who is in a suit that requires Vacc Suit 2 would have
    DM-2 to all their checks. Not having the skill at all
    inflicts the usual DM-3 unskilled penalty instead.
    
    Radiation is a very present danger to many Travellers,
    whether in combat or exploration. Some armour
    provides a measure of defence against radiation, as
    noted in the Rad column of the armour table. This
    amount is deducted from the rads a Traveller receives
    every time they are exposed to radiation.

    Various options can be added to armor. These options include: $list
Ablat:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    A cheap alternative to reflec, ablat armour
    is made from a material that ablates (vaporises)
    when hit by laser fire. Each laser hit on ablat armour
    reduces its Protection value against lasers by one but
    the armour is cheap and easily replaceable.
Battle Dress:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    The premier personal armour, battle
    dress is a powered form of combat armour but much
    tougher. The servomotors vastly increase the user’s
    speed and strength, increasing STR and DEX by +4
    while wearing the armour. Damage to the wearer’s
    characteristics is calculated as normal but the bonus
    values from the armour are used for all other purposes
    such as melee damage or skill checks. An on-board
    Computer/2 gives tactical advice and updates, and the
    suit is commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades.
    The suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour air supply
    and gives substantial protection against NBC (nuclear/
    biological/chemical) hazards. All weapons used while
    wearing battle dress count as having the Scope trait.

    **TL14**: This more advanced battle dress is
    considerably stronger, granting STR +6 and upgrades
    the internal systems to Computer/3.
Cloth:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic
    cloth. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads
    it over the body, which can result in bruising.
    However, cloth armour is highly useful and versatile.
    
    **TL10**: This armour is lighter and more flexible, and
    can be indistinguishable from ordinary clothing under
    normal circumstances.
Combat Armour:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    This full-body suit is used by the
    military and not generally available on the open
    market, although those with military or criminal
    contacts can obtain suits. It is issued to troop units
    and mercenary battalions. Combat armour can
    function as a vacc suit and provides life support for
    six hours. All weapons used while wearing combat
    armour count as having the Scope trait.

    **TL12**: Considerably lighter, substituting carbon-tube
    weave for the smart plastic of the previous generation.

    **TL14**: Offers vastly improved protection.
Flak Jacket:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    A less expensive version of ballistic
    cloth, the bulky flak jacket is an unmistakably
    military garment.
Hostile Environment Vacc Suit:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where
    a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as
    deep underwater, worlds with toxic atmosphere,
    extremes of radiation or temperature. HEV suits
    provide life support for six hours.
Jack:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body
    suit covering the torso and upper arms and legs. Jack
    is better than ordinary clothing or bare skin when
    defending against blades but is useless against guns.
Mesh:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or
    plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets.
Reflec:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    Reflec armour is a flexible plastic suit with
    layers of reflective material and heat-dispersing
    gel. It is highly effective against lasers but provides
    no protection against other attacks. Reflec can be
    worn with other armour but is hard to obtain, quite
    expensive and imposes DM-2 on any Stealth checks
    the wearer attempts.
Vacc Suit:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor
  text: >
    The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer’s
    best friend, providing life support and protection when in
    space. Early vacc suits are unwieldy and uncomfortable
    but quickly shrink as technology advances. A vacc suit
    provides life support for six hours.

    **TL10**: An improved version that masses a lot less.
    
    **TL12**:At this Tech Level, ‘tailored’ vacc suits feel like
    ordinary clothing with a flexible hood and face mask.
Chameleon, IR:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 12**
    
    This technology can be added
    to any full-body suit. It selectively bleeds heat to match
    background infrared levels and effectively renders the
    wearer invisible to infrared detection (DM-4 to detect
    with sensors).
Chameleon, Vislight:
  page: 102
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 12**
    
    A more advanced form of
    IR chameleon, vislight chameleon layers the surface of
    the armour with light-bending technology, making the
    wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye (DM-4 to spot).
Computer Weave:
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 10**
    
    Computer weave can be
    added to any armour that does not already have a
    computer system and adds a Computer/0 to that
    armour.
    
    TL11: Improved computer weave adds Computer/1.
    TL13: Advanced computer weave adds Computer/2.
Extended Life Support:
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 10**
    
    This upgrade can be
    added to any suit that provides life support (vacc suit,
    HEV suit, combat armour, battle dress). By adding highpressure
    oxygen tanks and recycling systems, the suit
    now provides 18 hours of oxygen.
Eye Protection:
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 6**
    
    A lot of armour includes eye
    protection such as visors or goggles to guard against
    flying debris but such protection becomes absolutely
    vital at TL9 to guard against the blinding effects of
    lasers. Eye protection can be added to any armour but is
    automatically included in any TL9+ armour.
Grav Assist:
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 12**
    
    This upgrade can be added to
    combat armour or battle dress only and adds the
    functionality of a grav belt (see page 119) to the armour.
    
    **TL15**: The TL15 version lasts longer.
Magnetic Grapples:
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 8**
    
    Magnetic plates in the boots
    of the armour allow the user to walk normally on a
    spacecraft without artificial gravity.
Medikit (TL10):
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 10**
    
    An internal medical scanner and drug
    injector, the medikit can be installed in combat armour,
    battle dress or a vacc suit. It automatically applies first
    aid if the Traveller is reduced to END 0 (treat as having
    Medic 3). It can also administer Fast Drug on command
    or if life support systems are failing.

    **TL11**: A military medikit can also inject combat drugs and
    metabolic accelerators on command.
Self-Sealing:
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 11**
    
    Self-sealing systems can be added
    to any armour (except ablat) when it is being made. The
    armour can seal breaches and repair minor damage. This
    cannot reconstruct a severely damaged suit of armour
    but does ensure that a ripped vacc suit or torn jacket
    repairs itself. Self-sealing only repairs minor damage -
    getting shot or stabbed is about the limit of the self-sealing
    capability to manage.
Smart Fabric:
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 10**
    
    Smart fabric resists stains and dirt,
    cleaning itself automatically, sloughing off dirt, dust and
    mud (this function can be suspended for the purposes of
    camouflage).
Thruster Pack:
  page: 104
  parent: Armor Options
  text: >
    **TL 9**
    
    A simple thruster pack gives the
    user the ability to manoeuvre in zero-gravity over short
    distances. An Athletics (dexterity) check is required to
    use it accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in
    microgravity environments.

    At **TL12**, the long-range thruster pack gives 0.1g
    acceleration for up to 48 hours, using standard starship
    fuel.

    The **TL14** version of the long-range pack is much
    smaller, as it uses grav-thruster plates instead but has
    the same performance profile as the TL12 version.
