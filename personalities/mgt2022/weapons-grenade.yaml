Grenades:

  text: >
    These weapons are thrown or launched at an enemy
    and are typically designed to affect several targets
    across a wide area at once.
    
    Thrown grenades use the Athletics (dexterity) skill,
    while those that are launched use the Heavy Weapons
    (portable) skill.
    
    Missed attacks with grenades will generally result
    in nothing interesting happening unless there are
    dangerous or amusing targets nearby, at the discretion
    of the referee.

    Aerosol grenades create a fine mist that
    diffuses any lasers that are fired into or through
    it but the mist does not block normal vision. Any
    laser attack tracing a line of sight into or through
    the mist has its damage reduced by -10. Laser
    communications are completely blocked by the
    mist. Aerosol clouds dissipate after 1D x 3 rounds,
    although heavy winds and rain can drastically reduce
    this time.

    Fragmentation grenades explode in a blast of
    shrapnel designed to kill or cripple anyone close by.
Smoke:

    Smoke grenades creates a thick cloud that
    disrupts vision. This imposes DM-2 to all attacks
    on targets within the cloud. IR vision completely
    bypasses this cloud of smoke. Smoke clouds
    dissipate after 1D x 3 rounds, although heavy winds
    and rain can drastically reduce this time.

    Stun grenades release a powerful pulse of
    energy, usually in the form or light and/or sound that
    incapacitates targets rather than killing them.
