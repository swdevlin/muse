    Designed to protect the wearer
    from extreme cold or heat, the environment suit has a
    hood, gloves and boots but leaves the face exposed
    in normal operations. A mask or rebreather can be
    attached but truly hostile situations call for the heavyduty
    hostile environment vacc suit.
Filter Mask:

  text: >
    Filters are breathing masks that strip
    out harmful elements from the air inhaled by the
    Traveller, such as dangerous gases or dust particles.
Grav Belt:

  text: >
    A harness worn across the body, the
    grav belt is equipped with artificial gravity modules,
    allowing the Traveller to fly. The internal battery can
    be operated for a maximum of four hours before
    recharging. At TL15, the battery can operate for 12
    hours before recharging. The grav belt allows the
    wearer to fly at Medium speed.
Habitat Module:

  text: >
    A modular unpressurised quarters
    for six people, capable of withstanding anything less
    than hurricane-force winds. Includes survival rations
    and battery power to last a week. Requires 12 manhours
    to assemble and can be attached to other
    modules to form a base.

    TL10: The TL10 module is pressurised and includes
    life-support for six occupants for one week (1,000
    person/hours).

    This is a light-duty
    portable fusion generator, capable of recharging
    weapons and other equipment for up to one month
    of use.
Radiation Suit:
  page: 119
  text: >
    A radiation suit protects the Traveller
    against direct radiation, such as solar flares or a
    reactor breach. A vacc suit will offer some protection
    but for areas of hard radiation a dedicated radiation
    suit is required, reducing exposure by 100 rads.
Rescue Bubble:
  page: 119
  text: >
    A large (two metre diameter)
    plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall
    translate the user’s movements into electricity to
    recharge the bubble’s batteries and power its distress
    beacon and a small oxygen tank both inflates the
    bubble and provides two person/hours of life support.
    A self-repairing plastic seal serves as an emergency
    airlock. Rescue bubbles are found on both space and
    sea vessels as emergency lifeboats.
Respirator:
  page: 119
  text: >
    This rebreather concentrates inhaled
    oxygen, allowing a Traveller to breathe on worlds with
    a thin atmosphere. Respirators take the form of a
    face mask or mouthpiece initially.
    
    TL10: The more advanced respirator is small enough
    to fit into the nose or can even be a lung implant.
Tent:
  page: 119
  text: >
    A basic tent provides shelter for two people
    against the weather.

    TL7: The TL7 version can be pressurised. There is no
    airlock – the tent is depressurised when opened.
Climate Controlled:
  page: 120
  text: >
    Structures can be given
    the climate-control option, allowing their internal
    temperature and other conditions to be controlled for
    comfort.
Self-Assembling:
  page: 120
  text: >
    The self-assembling upgrade
    can be given to tents, habitat modules and other basic
    structures. The structure is capable of expanding and
    assembling itself with only minimal aid, reducing the
    time needed to set up the shelter to a single man-hour.
Self-Sealing:
  page: 120
  text: >
    Structures can be made self-repairing
    and self-sealing. Small breaches
    and rips are automatically fixed in seconds.
