    Technical skills require specialist tools of various kinds.
    These kits contain diagnostic sensors, hand tools,
    computer analysis programs and spare parts.
    
    Toolkits may be purchased at higher Tech Levels and
    will be much more capable at fulfilling tasks. If a toolkit
    is at least two Tech Levels higher than the item or task
    that is being worked upon, it will grant DM+2 to all
    related checks. However, if a toolkit is two Tech Levels
    or more lower than the item or task that is being worked
    on, it will inflict DM-2 on all related checks.
    
    The basic toolkits are:
    
    • Electronics (specific skill): Required for performing repairs and installing new equipment.
    
    • Engineering (specific skill): Required for performing repairs and installing new equipment.
    
    • Forensics: Required for investigating crime scenes and testing samples.
    
    • Mechanical: Required for repairs and construction.
    
    • Scientific: Required for scientific testing and analysis. See Scientific Toolkits.
    
    • Surveying: Required for planetary surveys or mapping.
Scientific Toolkit:

  text: >
    A scientific toolkit is a set of instruments and dedicated
    expert computer packaged to help a professional
    perform specific science-related tasks. The combination
    of tools and expert computer provides DM+2 to Science
    checks related to the toolkit’s science-related speciality.

    Toolkit instruments are specific to a speciality or related
    specialties of scientific endeavours. The tools alone will
    provide DM+1 to checks related to their specialities for
    Travellers who have at least Science 0.
    
    Toolkit computers are tablets
    running Intellect and Expert software in the specified
    speciality. On their own they provide DM+1 to checks
    related to their specialities for Travellers who have at
    least Science 0 or allow unskilled Travellers to attempt
    Difficult (10+) or easier checks associated with the
    science speciality without an unskilled penalty.
Archaeology Science Toolkit:

    The archaeology toolkit provides deployable sensors and small
    tools for recovering and understanding
    the relics of past civilisations using the Science
    (archaeology) skill. The toolkit’s computing
    resources contain extensive databases of known relics
    and their context and a library of published papers. In
    addition, the archaeology toolkits will provide DM+1 to
    Science (history) checks related to archaeological finds.
Cybernetics Science Toolkit:

    This provides
    instruments to analyse, troubleshoot and repair
    cybernetic components using the Science (cybernetics)
    skill. This does not include the ability to construct components.
    The cybernetic toolkit also provides DM+1
    to Medic checks involving the intersection of biological
    and cybernetic components. The toolkit also provides
    DM+1 to Electronics (computers) or Profession (robotics)
    checks to repair cybernetic components.
Life Sciences Toolkit:

    The life science toolkit
    contains tools to aid the performance of tasks with the
    Science specialities of biology, genetics and xenology.
    The toolkit can also
    aid in medical diagnosis, providing a DM+1 to Medic or
    Investigate checks to diagnose a medical condition.
Planetology Science Toolkit:

  parent: Scientific Toolkit
  text: >
    This is a set of
    instruments intended to analyse the characteristics of a
    planetary environment using the Science (planetology)
    skill, applicable to the study of planets, asteroids,
    comets or other natural non-stellar bodies within a solar
    system. Additionally, the
    planetology toolkit provides DM+1 to tasks related
    to the environment of solar system bodies using the
    Science specialities of astronomy, chemistry or physics,
    and DM+1 to tasks related to the environmental
    conditions of lifeforms using the Science specialities of
    biology, genetics or xenology.
Psionicology Science Toolkit:

    This toolkit is generally considered contraband on worlds that prohibit
    the use of psionics. The
    toolkit includes testing equipment to determine the
    latent PSI potential of an individual, including tests for
    PSI strength and understanding talents, which can be
    trained. The toolkit provides feedback analytics for both
    psionic training and diagnosis of psionic-related mental
    conditions or psionic blocks and includes a dose of
    inhibitor drug to temporarily limit psionic ability.
Robotics Science Toolkit:

    For use with the Science
    (robotics) skill, this toolkit includes the tools to
    diagnose, repair and construct robotic components, but not
    a complete robot. This toolkit also provides DM+1
    to robotic related tasks performed using Electronics
    (computers) or Profession (robotics).
Space Sciences Toolkit:

    The space sciences
    toolkit contains sensors and analytic tools valuable
    to performance of the Science skill specialities
    of astronomy and cosmology. When
    used in conjunction with tasks related to the study of
    planetary and smaller system bodies using the Science
    (planetology) skill this toolkit provides DM+1.
Physical Sciences Toolkit:

  parent: Scientific Toolkit
  text: >
    This toolkit provides
    instruments and analytic tools for the performance of
    the Science skill specialities of chemistry and physics. The toolkit 
    can also aid the Science specialities
    of astronomy and planetology by providing DM+1
    in tasks which directly involve the measurement of
    physical and chemical properties.
Social Science Expert Packages:

    Social
    sciences do not generally require tools but access
    to methodologies, data collection algorithms and
    large libraries of information, both qualitative and
    quantitative. Social science expert packages are
    installed on specialised dedicated computer tablets
    running Intellect and Expert software in the speciality.
    These computers contain extensive databases and
    analysis engines for social science specialities and
    provide DM+2 to checks in the speciality. Travellers
    unskilled in the Science speciality of the Expert system
    may interact with the computer to understand or
    complete tasks of up to Very Difficult (12+) complexity
    with effective skill level 1 in the system’s speciality.
    Specific library packages apply to the economics,
    history, linguistics, philosophy, psychology and
    sophontology specialities.
