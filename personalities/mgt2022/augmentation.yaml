    While technology is capable of significantly altering and
    improving the body, obvious cybernetic, genetic or surgical
    alteration of the human form is frowned upon in many universes.
    
    
    While humans can be altered to survive on hostile worlds
    – denizens of a waterworld might be given gills and fingerwebbing,
    while those living on a world with dangerous native
    micro-organisms might have their immune and digestive
    systems altered to compensate – unnecessary augmentation
    is seen as unpleasant and even perverse in many cultures.
    There are some worlds where genetic alteration or cybernetics
    are widespread or even mandatory, just as there are worlds
    where they are strictly forbidden.
    
    
    Most of the items in this category can be cybernetic
    (mechanical or electronic implants and prostheses) or
    biological (genetic engineering and surgical alternation)
    or both (a more common solution) but the general term of
    ‘augment’ is used for all of them.


    Augments can interfere with medical treatment. All
    long-term care or surgery Medic checks treating an
    augmented Traveller suffer a negative DM equal to the
    difference in Tech Level between the medical facility
    and the highest relevant implant. For example, a
    Traveller with TL15 Endurance Augmentation implants
    being treated in a TL10 hospital would inflict DM-5 to
    the surgeon’s Medic skill checks.

Cognitive Augmentation:

  aliases:
    - cognitive
  parent: Augment

    Replacing slow nerve
    cells with faster synthetic substrates and implanting
    optoelectronic boosters can increase the speed at which
    a Traveller thinks, effectively boosting their intelligence.
Neural Comm:

    A neural comm has identical capacities
    to a standard comm but the cost is much higher as is
    the required TL. A Traveller can access the capabilities
    of a neural comm by thought alone but it still takes a
    skill check to use for complicated activities.

    A Traveller’s
    END, STR or DEX can be increased in various ways,
    from replacing motor neurons with faster synthetic
    cells, to reinforcing bones and replacing organs with
    tougher vat-grown clones. Augmentations must be
    purchased for each characteristic separately.
Subdermal Armour:

    Adds a mesh of ballistic
    fibres to the skin and reinforces the bones, giving
    the Traveller extra armour. Subdermal armour
    stacks with other protection.
Skill Augmentation:

  parent: Augment
  text: >
    The Traveller’s nervous
    system is rewired to be more suited to a particular
    task. A pilot might have their reflexes and sense of
    balance improved; a broker might be made capable
    of controlling their pupil responses and smelling
    pheromones and skin salinity of others. A skill
    augmentation gives the Traveller DM+1 when using
    that specific skill. A Traveller can only have one skill
    augmentation and must initially possess that skill at
    least at level 0 to benefit from the augmentation.
Wafer Jack:

    A wafer jack is a computer system
    implanted into the base of the skull that contains a
    physical data socket and processor running an interface
    program. A Traveller with a wafer jack can use Expert
    programs for tasks relying on INT or EDU only. The
    main benefit of the jack is that it is much smaller and
    more discrete than a hand computer and the user can
    access the Expert program by thought alone. A wafer
    jack has Computer/2 for Expert programs only and is
    always running Intelligence Interface.
    
    
    The Intelligence Interface does not use any
    Bandwidth, so all available Bandwidth may be used
    for Expert software. Swapping out software is done
    with physical media and not possible in the heat of
    the moment.
