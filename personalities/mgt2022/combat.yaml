Initiative:
  page: 73
  text: >
    At the start of any combat, every Traveller makes either a
    DEX or INT check. The Effect of this check is their Initiative for
    the duration of the combat and will reflect when they get
    to act in a combat round. Those with higher Initiatives act
    quicker than those with lower Effects.
Ambushes:
  page: 73
  text: >
    If one side is aware of the presence of the other but the
    other is unaware that they are nearby, then an ambush
    has taken place.
    
    The side that is aware that combat is about to begin
    gains DM+6 to its Initiative check for the first round
    only. The side that is not aware it is about to be
    attacked suffers DM-6 for the first round only.
Cover:
  page: 77
  text: >
    A Traveller using cover to shield themselves while
    engaging in combat inflicts DM-2 against all ranged
    attacks made against them.
Dual Weapons:
  page: 78
  aliases:
    - dual wield
  text: >
    If a Traveller is using two weapons at the same time,
    they may attack with both in the same combat round.
    However, they may not aim with either and will suffer
    DM-2 to the attack rolls of both. This penalty will not
    apply if the Traveller is carrying two weapons but only
    attacks with one.
Weapon Traits:
  page: 79
  text: >
    Some weapons have additional special rules that will
    greatly affect their use. The traits are: $list
AP X:
  page: 79
  aliases:
    - AP
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    This weapon has the ability to punch through
    armour through the use of specially shaped ammunition
    or high technology. It will ignore an amount of
    Protection equal to the AP score listed. Spacecraft
    scale targets (see page 167) ignore the AP trait unless
    the weapon making the attack is also Spacecraft scale.
Auto X:
  page: 79
  aliases:
    - Auto
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    These weapons fire multiple rounds with every
    pull of the trigger, filling the air with a hail of fire. A
    weapon with the Auto trait can make attacks in three
    fire modes: single, burst and full auto. Attacks using the
    Auto trait lose any benefits gained from aiming.

    • Single: Attacks are made using the normal combat
      rules.

    • Burst: Add the Auto score to damage. This uses a
      number of rounds equal to the Auto score.

    • Full Auto: Make a number of attacks equal to the
      Auto score. These attacks can be made against
      separate targets so long as they are all within six
      metres of one another. Full auto uses a number of
      rounds equal to three times the Auto score.

    A weapon cannot use the Auto trait in the same action
    as the Scope trait or an aiming action.
Blast X:
  page: 79
  aliases:
    - Blast
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    This weapon has an explosive component
    or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a
    wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled
    against every target within the weapon’s Blast score
    in metres. Dodge Reactions may not be made against
    a Blast weapon but targets may dive for cover. Cover
    may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target
    and the centre of the weapon’s Blast.
Bulky:
  page: 79
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    A Bulky weapon has a powerful recoil or is
    simply extremely heavy – this makes it difficult to use
    effectively in combat by someone of a weak physical
    stature. A Traveller using a Bulky weapon must have
    STR 9 or higher to use it without penalty. Otherwise,
    all attack rolls will have a negative DM equal to the
    difference between their STR DM and +1.
Radiation:
  page: 79
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    When a Radiation weapon is fired, the
    target will receive 2D x 20 rads (see page 81),
    multiplied by three for Spacecraft scale weapons (so,
    they deal 2D x 60 rads). If the Radiation weapon is
    Destructive, every target within 10 metres will also
    receive 2D x 20 rads.
Scope:
  page: 79
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    The weapon has been fitted with vision-enhancing
    sights, allowing it to put shots on target
    from far greater ranges. A weapon with the Scope trait
    ignores the rule that limits all attacks made at a range
    greater than 100 metres are automatically treated as
    being at Extreme range, so long as the Traveller aims
    before shooting.
Smart:
  page: 79
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    This weapon has intelligent or semi-intelligent
    rounds able to guide themselves onto a target. They
    gain a DM to their attack rolls equal to the difference
    between their TL and that of the target (usually their
    armour or vehicle, although Smart weapons can also
    home in one communications devices, computers and
    weapons). This DM will be a minimum of DM+1 and a
    maximum of DM+6.
Stun:
  page: 79
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    These weapons are designed to deal non-lethal
    damage, incapacitating a living target rather than killing
    it. Damage is only deducted from END, taking into
    account any Protection. If the target’s END is reduced
    to 0, the target will be incapacitated and unable to
    perform any actions for a number of rounds by which
    the damage exceeded their END. Damage received
    from Stun weapons is completely healed by one hour
    of rest.
Very Bulky:
  page: 79
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    Some weapons are designed only for the
    strongest combatants. A Traveller using a Very Bulky
    weapon must have STR 12 or higher to use it without
    penalty. Otherwise, all attack rolls will have a negative DM
    equal to the difference between their STR DM and +2.
Zero-G:
  page: 79
  parent: Weapon Traits
  text: >
    This weapon has little or no recoil, allowing
    it to be used in low or zero gravity situations without
    requiring an Athletics (dexterity) check.
