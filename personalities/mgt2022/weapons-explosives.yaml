    The Explosives skill is used with explosives. Multiply
    the damage of the explosives by the Effect of the
    Explosives check used to set them.

    Doubling the amount of explosives used will increase
    the Damages by 1D and the Blast by +1. Continually
    doubling the amount of explosives used will have a
    cumulative effect.

    **6DD**
    
    Hideously illegal on many worlds, the
    pocket nuke is actually the size of a briefcase and
    so is too large to fit into a grenade launcher. Using
    multiple pocket nukes will not increase the Damage
    or Burst of the explosion.
