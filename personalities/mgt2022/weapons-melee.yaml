    Melee weapons are a symbol of status among the
    nobility of many worlds but they also serve a useful
    purpose in boarding actions. When attempting to
    capture an enemy vessel, a sword is much less likely
    to cause significant damage to vulnerable systems or
    cause a hull breach than a gun but is better at opening
    a self-sealing vacc suit to the airless cold of space.
    
    These weapons require the Melee skill, using the blade
    speciality if they have a sharp edge, bludgeon if they
    do not and unarmed if you are left with nothing but your
    fists; though fists are a poor substitute against a better
    prepared enemy.

    remain a popular and practical weapon regardless.
