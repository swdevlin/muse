Characteristics:
  text: >
    Characteristics measure a character's most basic abilities: how strong,
    dexterous, educated or intelligent they are. Characteristic scores influence
    almost everything your character does. Stronger characters can lift greater
    weights, more dexterous characters have better balance, and so forth.


    Characters have six abilities: $list. Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance
    are called physical abilities, whereas Intelligence, Education, and
    Social Standing are loosely termed mental abilities.
    
    
    Each above-average ability score provides a bonus on certain die rolls;
    while below average abilities apply a penalty to some die rolls.
