Cryoberth (TL10):
  page: 114
  text: >
    A cryoberth, or ‘icebox’, is a
    coffin-like machine similar to the low or frozen berths
    used on some spacecraft. The main difference is
    that a cryoberth works much faster than a low berth,
    freezing and preserving its occupant almost instantly.
    A cryoberth can therefore be used to place a severely
    injured Traveller into stasis until they receive medical
    treatment. A cryoberth’s internal power system can
    function for up to one week on its own but a berth
    is usually connected to a vehicle’s or ship’s power
    supply.
Medikit (TL8+):
  page: 114
  text: >
    There are different types of medikit
    available at different Tech Levels. All medikits
    contain diagnostic devices and scanners, surgical
    tools and a panoply of drugs and antibiotics,
    allowing a medic to practise their art in the field.
    Advanced medikits can help with more exotic
    problems or when treating augmented individuals.
    For example, a TL8 medikit can test blood pressure
    and temperature, while a TL14 kit has a medical
    densitometer to create a three-dimensional view
    of the patient’s body and can scan brain activity on
    the quantum level. All medikits mass 1kg, except at
    TL14 where they have an effective mass of 0kg.
    
    TL10 grants DM+1 on Medic checks performed for first aid.
    
    TL12 grants DM+2 on Medic checks performed for first aid.
    
    TL14 grants DM+3 on Medic checks performed for first aid.
Meds:

    The following are the drugs (or ‘meds’) in standard use: $list
Anagathics:

  parent: meds
  text: >
    These slow the user’s ageing
    process. Synthetic anagathics become possible at
    TL15 but there are natural spices and other rare
    compounds that have comparable effects. Anagathics
    are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. One
    dose must be taken each month to maintain the antiaging
    effect.
Anti-rad:

  aliases:
    - anti-radiation
  text: >
    Anti-rad drugs must be administered
    before or immediately (within 10 minutes) after
    radiation exposure. They absorb up to 100 rads per
    dose. A Traveller may only use anti-rad drugs once
    per day – taking any more causes permanent END
    damage of 1D per dose.
Combat Drugs:

  parent: meds
  text: >
    Combat drugs increase
    reaction times and improve a body’s responses to
    trauma. A Traveller using combat drugs gains DM+4
    to all Initiative rolls. They also gain a free Reaction
    every round with no penalty applied and reduces all
    damage sustained by -2 points. The drug kicks in
    around 20 seconds (three rounds) after ingestion or
    injection and lasts for around 10 minutes. When the
    drug wears off, the user is Fatigued (see page 80).
Fast Drug:
  page: 115
  parent: meds
  text: >
    Also called Hibernation, this
    drug puts the user into a state akin to suspended
    animation, slowing their metabolic rate down to a
    ratio of 60:1 – a subjective day for the user is actually
    two months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong
    life support reserves or as a cheap substitute for a
    cryoberth.
Medicinal Drugs:

  parent: meds
  text: >
    Includes vaccines,
    antitoxins and antibiotics. They range in cost from Cr5
    to several thousand Credits, depending on the rarity
    and complexity. Medicinal drugs require the Medic
    skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be
    worse than doing nothing.
Metabolic Accelerator:
  page: 115
  parent: meds
  text: >
    These boost the
    user’s reaction time to superhuman levels. To the user,
    everyone else appears to be moving much slower.
    A Traveller using a metabolic accelerator in combat
    gains DM+8 to all Initiative rolls. They also gain two
    free Reactions every round with no penalties applied
    for either. The drug kicks in 45 seconds after ingestion
    or injection and lasts for around 10 minutes. When the
    drug wears off, the user’s system crashes. They suffer
    2D points of damage and is Fatigued (see page 80).
Panaceas (TL8+):
  page: 115
  parent: meds
  text: >
    These are wide-spectrum
    medicinal drugs specifically designed not to interact
    harmfully. They can therefore be used on any wound
    or illness and are guaranteed not to make things
    worse. A Traveller using panaceas may make a
    Medic check as if they had Medic 0 when treating an
    infection or disease.
Slow Drug:
  page: 115
  parent: meds
  text: >
    This is a variant of the metabolic
    accelerator. It can only be applied safely in a medical
    facility where life-support and cryotechnology is
    available, as it increases the metabolism to around 30
    times normal, allowing a patient to undergo a month
    of healing in a single day. Using this drug outside
    of a hospital or sickbay is a messy and painful way
    to commit suicide, as the user will rapidly cook their
    internal organs and suffer massive brain damage.
Stims:
  page: 115
  parent: meds
  text: >
    These relieve fatigue, although at a
    cost. A Traveller who uses stims removes Fatigue
    (see page 80) but also sustains one point of damage.
    If stims are used repeatedly without natural sleep
    in between, the user suffers a cumulative additional
    point of damage every time (so, on the second use,
    two points of damage are sustained, on the third,
    three points and so on).
