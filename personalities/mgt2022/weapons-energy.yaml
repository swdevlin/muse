    Directed-energy weapons first enter the battlefield
    as target designators and range-finders but by TL9
    weapons capable of inflicting damage directly appear.
    Laser weapons require a power supply – pistols come
    with a belt- or wrist-mounted power pack, while rifles
    come with backpacks connected by a cable. As the
    Tech Level increases, power packs gradually become
    integrated into the weapons themselves.
    
    All energy weapons come with a power pack that can
    be recharged using a ship’s power plant or another
    power source. It takes eight hours to recharge a
    power pack and switching from one pack to another is
    a Minor Action.

    **Tl9  3D**

    The TL9 pistol is bulky but effective,
    with no recoil and a large magazine. At TL11,
    advances in battery technology and miniaturisation
    mean the pistol is no larger than a conventional
    firearm but must still be connected to a battery pack
    for sustained use.

    lighter than laser rifles and have a correspondingly
    shorter range.

    **Tl12  5D+3**

    A six-shot model designed
    to be used for mobile sniping. The power pack is
    integrated into the weapon itself, removing the
    need for a heavy backpack.

    **Tl16  6D**

    TL16 technology allows the bulky
    reactor and plasma chamber of the PGHP to be made
    small enough to fit into a rifle frame. The plasma rifle is
    a high-powered weapon designed to crack battle dress.
