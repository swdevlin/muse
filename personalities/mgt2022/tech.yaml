    **TL0 (Primitive)**: No technology. TL0 worlds have only discovered the
    simplest tools and principles and are on par with Earth’s Stone Age.
    
    **TL1 (Primitive)**: Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology.
    TL1 science is mostly superstition but manufacture weapons and work metals.
    
    **TL2 (Primitive)**: Renaissance technology. TL2 brings with it a greater
    understanding of chemistry, physics, biology and astronomy as well as the
    scientific method.
    
    **TL3 (Primitive)**: The advances of TL2 are now applied, bringing the
    germ of industrial revolution and steam power. Primitive firearms now 
    dominate the battlefield. This is roughly comparable to the early 19th
    Century.

    **TL4 (Industrial)**: The transition to industrial revolution is complete,
    bringing plastics, radio and other such inventions. Roughly comparable to 
    the late 19th/early 20th Century.
    
    **TL5 (Industrial)**: TL5 brings widespread electrification, 
    telecommunications and internal combustion. At the high end of the TL, 
    atomics and primitive computing appear. Roughly on a par with the
    mid-20th Century.
    
    **TL6 (Industrial)**: TL6 brings the development of fission power and more
    advanced computing. Advances in materials technology and rocketry bring
    about the dawn of the space age.

    **TL7 (Pre-Stellar)**: A pre-stellar society can reach orbit reliably and
    has telecommunications satellites. Computers and integrated circuits become
    ubiquitous. At the time of writing, Earth is currently somewhere between TL7
    and TL8.
    
    **TL8 (Pre-Stellar)**: At TL8, it is possible to reach other worlds in the
    same star system, although terraforming or full colonisation are not within 
    the culture’s capacity. Permanent space habitats become possible. Fusion
    power becomes commercially viable.
    
    **TL9 (Pre-Stellar)**: The defining element of TL9 is the development of
    gravity manipulation, which makes space travel vastly safer and faster. This
    research leads to development of the jump drive, which occurs near the end 
    of this Tech Level. TL9 cultures can colonise other worlds, although
    travelling to a colony is often a one-way trip.

    **TL10 (Early Stellar)**: With the advent of commonly available jump drives,
    nearby systems are opened up. Orbital habitats and factories become common.
    Interstellar travel and trade lead to an economic boom. Colonies become much
    more viable.
    
    **TL11 (Early Stellar)**: The first true artificial intelligences become
    possible, as computers are able to model synaptic networks. Grav-supported
    structures reach to the heavens. Jump-2 travel becomes possible, allowing
    easier travel beyond the one jump stellar mains.
    
    **TL12 (Average Stellar)**: Planetwide weather control revolutionises
    terraforming and agriculture. Portable plasma weapons and carrier-mounted
    fusion guns make the battlefield untenable for unarmoured combatants.
    Jump-3 travel is developed.
    
    **TL13 (Average Stellar)**: Battle dress appears on the battlefield in
    response to new weapons, heralding the pinnacle of personal armour and
    making infantry the equivalent of less advanced armoured vehicles.
    Cloning of body parts becomes easy. Jump-4 travel appears.
    
    **TL14 (Average Stellar)**: Fusion weapons become portable. Flying 
    cities appear. Jump-5 drives are built.
    
    **TL15 (High Stellar)**: Black globe generators suggest a new direction
    for defensive technologies, while the development of synthetic anagathics
    means that human lifespan is now vastly increased.
