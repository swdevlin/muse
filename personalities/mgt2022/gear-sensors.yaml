    Allow the user to see further.
    
    TL8: Electronic enhancement allows images to be
    captured; light-intensification allows them to be used
    in the dark.

    TL12: PRIS (Portable Radiation Imaging System)
    allows the user to observe a large section of the EMspectrum,
    from infrared to gamma rays.
Bioscanner:

    The bioscanner ‘sniffs’ for organic
    molecules and tests chemical samples, analysing the
    make-up of whatever it is focused on. It can be used
    to detect poisons or bacteria, analyse organic matter,
    search for life signs and classify unfamiliar organisms.
Densitometer:

    The remote densitometer uses an
    object’s natural gravity to measure its density, building
    up a three-dimensional image of the inside and outside
    of an object.
EM Probe:

    This handy device detects the electromagnetic
    emissions of technological devices and can be
    used as a diagnostic tool when examining equipment or
    when searching for hidden bugs or devices.
Geiger Counter:

    Detects radiation.
IR Goggles:

    Permits the user to see exothermic
    (heat-emitting) sources in the dark.
Light Intensifier Goggles:

    Permits the users to
    see normally in anything less than total darkness by
    electronically intensifying any available light.
    
    TL9: Combines with IR goggles into a single unit.

    The Neural Activity Scanner consists of a
    backpack and detachable handheld unit and can detect
    neural activity up to 500 metres away. The device can
    also give a rough estimation of the intelligence level of
    organisms based on brainwave patterns.
