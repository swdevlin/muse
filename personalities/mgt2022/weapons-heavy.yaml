    The ultimate personal firearm, the Fusion Gun,
    Human Portable (similar weapons are available for
    other alien species) is more like a piece of artillery.
    It includes a gravity suspension system to reduce its
    inertia and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear
    explosion. Those without radiation protection who are
    nearby when a FGHP is fired will suffer a potentially
    lethal dose of radiation.

    The Plasma Gun, Human Portable is the
    standard assault weapon of the marines. It is so heavy
    and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper
    in battle dress. It is powered by a built-in micro-fusion
    generator and fires a high-energy plasma stream.
    More advanced plasma guns adjust the weaponâ€™s
    optimum range and plasma temperature.

    **5D+6**
    
    A simple tube device that
    launches rockets. Anyone standing behind a rocket
    launcher when it is fired will be caught in its back blast
    and suffer 3D damage from the burning gasses. It
    takes three Minor Actions to reload a rocket launcher.
