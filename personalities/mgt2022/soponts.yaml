    An intelligent being; a being with a base reasoning capacity roughly
    equivalent to or greater than that of a human being. The word does not
    apply to machines unless they have true artificial intelligence, rather
    than mere processing capacity.

    The Aslan are the youngest of the great powers, an
    expansionist race of feuding clans and predatory
    warriors, eager to seize all the universe has to offer.
    Aslan are descended from four-limbed carnivorous
    pouncer stock which was originally near the top of the
    food chain in the forests of their homeworld, Kusyu. True
    to their pouncer ancestry, Aslan are capable of short
    bursts of speed somewhat greater than that manageable
    by humans. They also have slightly superior hearing and
    night vision. Otherwise, they are one of the most humanlike
    of all alien races, excepting, of course, the Vargr
    (who are, after all, genetically-altered mammalian stock
    originally from Earth).
    
    
    Early Terran explorers regarded the Aslan as ‘lion-like’, and
    the simile has stuck ever since, although the Aslan bear
    only a passing resemblance to terrestrial lions. Nonetheless,
    this early misnomer has influenced a great deal of human
    thinking about the Aslan, including terminology (the use of
    pride to translate ahriy, for instance) and ascribed behaviour
    – which is not at all leonine.

    The Vargr are the only major race to have been uplifted by
    the Ancients, a fact that the Vargr are extremely proud of.
    They are typically seen by other races as aggressive pirates
    and scavengers but the Vargr actually have a diverse
    culture that is deeply rooted in their pack mentality and
    the desire for companionship, charisma and loyalty. Their
    constant struggle for charisma and leadership results in a
    culture fuelled by conflict and change.
    
    
    The Vargr are descended from carnivore/chaser stock;
    genetically engineered by the Ancients circa –300,000
    from the genus Canis. The carnivores were transplanted
    from Terra to Lair/Grnouf in the Provence sector. The Vargr
    bear a close resemblance to their canine ancestry, as
    can be seen by their muzzle, tail and fur, though several
    anatomical modifications were made by the Ancients
    to the canine body structure. Vargr adopt a digitigrade
    stance (putting their weight on their toes rather than the
    soles of their feet) and many have a slight stoop.

    The Vegans are an alien race native to Muan Gwi in the
    Vega subsector, named after the bright star near their
    homeworld. They call themselves Tyui but prefer the
    popular term Vegan when interacting with others. A
    Vegan is roughly humanoid in shape but very nonhuman
    in appearance. They have two legs, two arms and a head
    but completely nonhuman in detail. Their bodies are
    upright, bipedal and bilaterally symmetrical, towering
    over an average Solomani or Vilani with an average
    height of 2.2 metres.

    Hivers are a unique species with few species bearing any real commonalities
    with Hivers, either in mindset, physiology, or otherwise. In a universe where
    humanoids seem to predominate, they are non-humanoids. In a universe that
    favors the violent and selfish, Hivers are altruists and seek to elevate
    life. In a world of intense competition and deadly contests of survival,
    the Hivers build vast, peaceful communities and make friends where enemies
    once existed.
    
    
    Descended from omnivore gatherer/scavenger stock, they are the most alien
    of the major races. Hivers evolved from troglobytic (cave-dwelling)
    creatures who developed mutualistic relationships with other cave-dwellers.
    Hivers like planets of size 6 or less, with thin or standard atmospheres
    and unvarying climates.
