Active Player:
  text: >
    The phrase “active player” is used to refer to a player who is obligated to
    perform (or granted the option to perform) a specific game function during a
    framework step or special action window.
Active Location:
  text: >
    When the players travel to a location, it is removed from the staging area
    and placed next to the quest deck, causing it to become the active location.
        
    ⦁ There can only be one active location at a time. The players cannot travel if another location card is active.

    ⦁ The active location does not contribute its threat strength to the total threat strength in the staging area.

    ⦁ The active location acts as a buffer for the current quest. Any progress tokens that would be placed on the current quest are instead placed on the active location, up to that location’s quest points.

    ⦁ If the active location becomes explored by a game or card effect that requires the placement of multiple progress  on the quest (and the progress is instead being placed on the active location), the remaining progress created by  the effect is placed on the current quest.
Aflame X:
  aliases:
    - aflame
  text: >
    At the end of each round, the players must place 1 damage token on each
    Aflame location in the staging area. Many encounter card effects can also
    cause damage tokens to be placed on Aflame locations.


    If at any point an Aflame location has damage tokens on it equal to its Aflame X value, it is destroyed, and must be placed facedown underneath The Havens Burn objective card. Cards facedown underneath The Havens Burn are considered to be out of play.


    If an Aflame location is explored, it is placed in the discard pile as normal, and all damage tokens on it are also discarded.
Ally Cards:
  aliases:
    - ally
    - allies
  text: >
    Ally cards represent characters (friends, followers, creatures,
    and  hirelings) that assist a player’s heroes on the quest. Ally cards
    are  played from a player’s hand, and they remain in play until they are
    destroyed.
Ally Objective Cards:
  aliases:
    - ally objective
  text: >
    Ally objective cards revealed from the encounter deck during the quest phase
    enter the staging area as an objective. If players claim the objective, as
    instructed by the card text, the objective becomes an ally under control  of
    the first player. If the objective ally leaves play for any reason, it the
    card is placed in the encounter discard pile.
Ambush:
  text: >
    When an enemy with the ambush keyword enters play, each player,
    starting  with the first player and proceeding clockwise, must make an
    engagement check.


    The engagement check is only made against the enemy that just entered play, and not other enemies that are in the staging area. If the enemy engages a player as the result of this effect, then no further engagement checks are made against it.
Archery:
  aliases:
    - archery x
  text: >
    While a card with the archery keyword is in play, players must deal damage
    to character cards in play equal to the specified archery value at the
    beginning of each combat phase. This damage can be dealt to characters under
    any player’s control, and it can be divided among the players as they see
    fit. If there is disagreement as to where to assign archery damage, the
    first player makes the final decision. If multiple cards with the archery
    keyword are in play, the effects are cumulative. Remember that
    <:lotrdefense:971732765810761758>  does not block archery damage.
Assault:
  text: >
    When the players quest unsuccessfully, each player does not raise his or her
    threat. Instead, the players must deal X damage to Minas Tirith. X is the
    amount by which the total threat in the staging area was greater than the
    total willpower of each character committed to the quest. (This damage is
    only calculated once for the group, not per player.)
Attack Strength:
  text: >
    Each character and enemy has an attack strength. This value is the amount of
    damage that character or enemy deals when it attacks. Attack strength is
    denoted by the <:attack:971552111034761216> symbol.
Battle:
  aliases:
    - battle quest
  text: >
    If a quest card has the battle keyword, when characters are committed
    to  that quest, they count their total <:lotrattack:971732794491420672>
    instead of their total <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> when resolving
    the quest. Enemies and locations in the staging area still use their
    <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> in opposition to this quest attempt.
Blank:
  text: >
    If an ability causes a card’s printed text box to be considered “blank,”
    that text box is treated as if it did not have any of its printed text. Text
    gained from another source is not blanked.

    ⦁ Included in a card’s text box are its abilities, keywords, and traits.

    ⦁ A card with a blank text box retains its flavor and/or story text.
Boarding X:
  aliases:
    - boarding
  text: >
    When a ship-enemy with the Boarding keyword engages a player from the
    staging area, reveal the top X cards from the Corsair Deck and put the
    revealed enemies into play, engaged with that player. Note that the Boarding
    keyword does not resolve if the ship-enemy engages a player from another
    player’s play area, or from the encounter deck or discard pile.
Burgle:
  text: >
    To make a burgle attempt, the first player must follow these steps:


    **Step 1** - When a card instructs the first player to make a burgle  attempt, he or she must discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until a card with a burgle effect is discarded. Read and resolve the burgle effect as outlined in steps 2 and 3.

    **Step 2** - The first player shuffles his deck and reveals the top card. If the first player has no cards left in his or her deck, then the burgle attempt automatically fails.

    **Step 3** - Each burgle effect instructs the first player to discard a number of cards that match either the revealed card’s sphere, type, cost, or a combination of those things. If the first player discards the required cards from his or her hand, the burgle attempt is successful. If the player cannot, the burgle attempt fails.
Cancel:
  text: >
    Some card abilities (usually response abilities) can “cancel” other card or
    game effects. Cancel abilities interrupt the initiation of an effect, and
    prevent the effect from initiating. Because of this, cancel abilities have
    timing priority over all other abilities.
        
    ⦁ If an effect is canceled, that effect is no longer imminent, and further abilities (including cancels) cannot be initiated in reference to the canceled effect.

    ⦁ When the effects of an ability are canceled, the ability is still considered to have been used, and any costs have still been paid.

    ⦁ If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and it is still placed in its owner’s discard pile.

    ⦁ If the effects of a treachery card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been revealed, and it is still placed in the encounter discard pile.
Cannot:
  text: >
    The word “cannot” is absolute, and cannot be countermanded by other
    abilities or effects.
Capture X:
  aliases:
    - capture
  text: >
    When an encounter card or quest card with the capture X keyword enters
    play,  before resolving that card’s “when revealed” effects, each player
    takes the top X cards of his or her captured deck and captures them by
    placing them  facedown underneath that card. (If the players are at
    different stages of the quest, only the players at that stage perform this
    act.)


    When cards are captured facedown underneath an encounter card, those cards are called “captured cards,” and are considered to be out of play, under no player’s control. This can occur from the capture X keyword, or from encounter card effects that instruct a player to capture 1 or more cards  underneath a specified card. If a card is captured from play, all tokens on that card and attachments on that card are discarded. When an encounter card or quest card with 1 or more captured cards underneath it leaves play, all of the captured cards underneath it are “rescued” by their owners. Rescued cards are placed in their owners’ hands. If a hero card is rescued, immediately put it into play under its owner’s control.
Cardtypes:
  aliases:
    - card types
  text: >
    The game’s cardtypes are: quest, enemy, location, treachery, objective,
    hero, ally, attachment, and event. Each of these card types, with a detailed
    card anatomy, is presented in Appendix I.

    If an ability causes a cardtype to change (such as an ally card becoming an enemy card), it loses all other cardtypes it might possess and functions as would any card of the new type.
Character Cards:
  text: >
    Character cards represent the different companions who come together to
    complete each quest. Character cards are divided into 2 types: heroes and
    allies. Any ability that refers to a “character” refers to both types.


    Some abilities, however, may refer only to a particular type, or may exclude a type, based on the ability text.
        
    ⦁ Characters enter play ready, in a player’s play area, and under their owner’s control.

    ⦁ Characters remain in play unless they are destroyed or removed by a game step or ability.
The word “Choose”:
  text: >
    The word “choose” indicates that a game element (most often a card) must be
    chosen as the target of an effect.

    ⦁ The controller of an ability that uses the word “choose” chooses all targets for the effect unless otherwise specified by the card.

    ⦁ If there is no valid target for a targeting effect, the ability cannot be initiated.
Clue Objectives:
  text: >
    In some scenarios, players are searching for Clue objective cards. Players
    should try  to find and claim as many copies of them as they can while
    playing the scenario.


    When one of these cards is claimed, its card text transforms it into a condition attachment, and it is attached to a hero committed to the quest, with text that returns the card to the top of the encounter deck if the attached hero is destroyed.  Additionally, if the attached hero is destroyed or leaves play for any other reason, the clue objective card is returned to the top of the encounter deck.
Combat Phase:
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to resolve attacks are described in timing
    entries 6.1–6.11 on page 26.
Constant Ability:
  text: >
    A constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text contains no
    boldface timing trigger defining its ability type. A constant ability
    becomes active as soon as its card enters play and remains active while the
    card is in play.

    ⦁ Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition (denoted by words such as “during,” “if,” or “while”). The effects of such abilities are active any time the specified condition is met.

    ⦁ If multiple instances of the same constant ability are in play, each instance affects the game state independently.
Contracts:
  text: >
    Contracts count as player cards, but they are never included in a player’s
    deck and do not count towards a player’s minimum deck size. Instead, each
    player may choose one contract to put into play along with his or her heroes
    at the beginning of the game with its “A” side faceup. If a contract places
    restrictions on the contents of a player’s deck, those restrictions must be
    met in order to choose that contract.
Controlling Locations:
  aliases:
    - losing control of locations
  text: >
    To take control of a location, the first player removes all progress from
    the just explored location and places it in front of him or her in his or
    her play area instead of discarding it. Locations under any player’s control
    are still in play. Their game text is active and they can be affected by
    card effects.


    When a player returns a controlled location to the staging area, he or she  loses control of that location and removes all progress from it. If a player is eliminated from the game, each location controlled by that player is returned to the staging area
Copy (of a card):
  aliases:
    - copy of a card
  text: >
    A copy of a card is defined by title: any other card that shares the same
    title is considered a copy, regardless of cardtype, text, artwork, or any
    other characteristic(s) of the card(s).
Cost:
  text: >
    A card’s resource cost is the numerical value that must be paid to play the
    card.


    Some abilities have a cost described in the ability text that must be paid in order to use the ability.

    ⦁ When a player is paying a cost, the payment must be made with cards and/or game elements that player controls.

    ⦁ If a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player paying the cost may only use game elements that are in his or her out-of-play areas.

    ⦁ If multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.

    ⦁ An ability’s cost cannot be paid if the resolution of its effect does not have the potential to change the game state.

    ⦁ The word “to” is used in ability text to distinguish a cost from an effect, in a “pay cost to resolve effect” format.
Current Quest:
  text: >
    The “current quest” refers to the quest stage that the players are currently
    attempting to defeat.
Defence:
  text: >
    While the current quest has the defense keyword, players cannot place
    progress on the quest (or active location) by questing
    successfully.  Instead, the encounter deck tries to place progress on the
    current quest.


    During quest resolution, if the total <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> in  the staging area is greater than the total <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> of characters committed to the quest, players do not raise their threat by the difference. Instead, the first player places progress on the current quest equal to the difference.


    The active location still acts as a buffer to the quest, so progress made by the encounter deck or encounter card effect must be placed on the active location first before it is placed on the quest (unless a card effect bypasses the active location). When a quest has progress equal to its quest points, that stage is defeated and the players should advance to the next stage as usual.
Damage:
  text: >
    Damage tokens can be placed on character cards and enemies by attacks and by
    various abilities. If a character or enemy has as much (or more) damage on
    it as it has hit points, it is destroyed.


    The following process is used to deal damage:

    1. Determine the amount of damage to deal (including modifiers).

    2. Assign the damage to the target (character or enemy).

    3. Place the damage on the target (character or enemy).
Defending Player:
  text: >
    When an enemy makes an attack against a player, or against a character
    controlled by a player, that player is the defending player.


    If another player declares a sentinel character as a defender, the player that the enemy is attacking is still the defending player. Card effects, including shadow card effects, that target  “the defending player” or “you” still target the player who the enemy is attacking.

    ⦁ If an enemy is attacking a specific character, the player who controls that character is the defending player.
Defense Strength:
  text: >
    Each character and enemy has a defense strength. This value is the amount of
    damage a character reduces an attack by when it defends, or the amount of
    damage an enemy reduces an attack by when that enemy is attacked.

    ⦁ Defense strength is denoted by the <:defense:971552214013333524> symbol.
Delayed Effects:
  text: >
    Some abilities contain delayed effects. Such abilities specify a future
    timing point, or indicate a future condition that may arise, and dictate an
    effect that is to happen at that time.

    ⦁ Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after their specified timing point / future condition  occurs or becomes true, before reactions to that moment may be used.

    ⦁ When a delayed effect resolves, it is not treated as a new triggered ability, even if the delayed effect was originally created by a triggered ability.
Destroy:
  aliases:
    - destroyed
  text: >
    When a hero or ally is destroyed, it is placed faceup on top of its owner’s
    discard pile. When an enemy is destroyed, it is placed faceup on top of the
    encounter discard pile.


    Placing a hero, ally, or enemy in the discard pile as the result of being destroyed is not the same as “discarding” that card.
Dire:
  text: >
    While the main quest has the dire keyword, each player’s threat
    elimination  level is increased to 99 and each player’s threat cannot be
    reduced by more than 1 each round by non-boon player card effects. Boon card
    effects that reduce a player’s threat are not affected by the dire keyword.
    Additionally, the threat value for triggering Valour effects is changed from
    40 threat to 80.
Discard Pile:
  text: >
    Many game effects place cards in a player’s discard pile or the encounter
    discard pile.

    ⦁ Each player has his or her own discard pile, and the encounter deck also has its own discard pile.

    ⦁ When a card is discarded, it goes to the discard pile belonging to the card’s originating deck.

    ⦁ Each discard pile is open information and may be looked at by any player at any time.

    ⦁ The order of cards in a discard pile may not be altered unless a player is instructed to do so by a card ability.

    ⦁ If multiple cards would enter a discard pile simultaneously, the owner of the cards chooses the order in which those cards are placed in the discard pile.
Does not Stack:
  text: >
    While two or more effects that do not stack with one another are
    active,  only one of them will affect the game state.
Doomed X:
  alias:
    - doomed
  text: >
    Doomed is a keyword ability. If an encounter card with the doomed
    keyword  is revealed, each player must raise his or her threat by the
    specified value. If a player card with the Doomed X keyword is played or put
    into play, each player must raise his or her threat level by the specified
    amount.
Drawing cards:
  aliases:
    - draw
    - card draw
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to draw one or more cards, those cards are drawn
    from the top of his or her deck.


    When a player draws two or more cards as the result of a single game step or card ability, those cards are drawn simultaneously.


    Drawn cards are added to a player’s hand.


    There is no limit to the number of cards a player may draw each round.


    There is no maximum hand size.
Effects:
  text: >
    A card effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of ability text
    printed on or gained by a card. A framework effect is any effect that arises
    from the resolution of a framework step.

    ⦁ Card effects might be preceded by costs, triggering   conditions, play restrictions, play permissions, and/ or targeting requirements. Such elements are not   considered effects.

    ⦁ Once an ability is initiated, players must resolve as much of each aspect of the effect as they are able, unless the effect uses the word “may.”

    ⦁ When a non-targeting effect attempts to engage a number of entities (such as “draw 3 cards” or “search the top 10 cards of your deck”) that exceeds the number of entities that currently exist in the specified game area, the effect engages as many entities as possible.

    ⦁ The expiration of a lasting effect (or the cessation of a constant ability) is not considered to be generating a game state change by card effect.

    ⦁ If an ability instructs a player to select among multiple effects, an effect that has the potential to  change the game state must be selected.
Encounter:
  text: >
    Encounter is a keyword that appears on player cards with an encounter card
    back, and it has the following rules:

    ⦁ Player cards with the encounter keyword cannot be included in any player’s deck because they have encounter card backs. Instead, when setting up a scenario, each player may set up to 3 cards with the encounter keyword aside, out of play. These cards do not count toward the player’s deck minimum of 50 cards.

    ⦁ Player cards with the encounter keyword have a dash (-) instead of a cost because they are never played from a player’s hand. Instead, player cards with the encounter keyword are meant to be shuffled into the encounter deck. In order to shuffle one of the set aside player cards into the encounter deck, a card effect must instruct a player to do so.

    ⦁ The “when revealed” effect on player cards with the encounter keyword cannot be canceled.

    ⦁ If a player card with the encounter keyword is dealt as a shadow card to an enemy, it is treated like an encounter card: place it in the encounter discard pile after resolving that enemy’s attack.

    ⦁ If a player card with the encounter keyword leaves play, it is removed from the game. Do not place it in a player’s discard pile or in the encounter deck discard pile.
Encounter Deck:
  text: >
    The encounter deck contains the villains, hazards, places, and circumstances
    that stand between the players and the successful completion of their quest.

    ⦁ An encounter deck consists of enemy, location, treachery, and objective cards.

    ⦁ The contents of the encounter deck are determined by the scenario the players are attempting.
Encounter Phase:
  page: 24
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to resolve engagement checks are described
    in timing entries 5.1–5.4.
Encounter Side Quests:
  parent: side quests
  text: >
    A side quest with an encounter card back is called an “encounter side
    quest.” An encounter side quest is both a quest card and an encounter card.
    Each encounter side quest is part of an encounter set and it is shuffled
    into the encounter deck when setting up a scenario that uses its encounter
    set. When an encounter side quest is revealed from the encounter deck, it is
    added to the staging area. Because side quests are quest cards as well as
    encounter cards, the “when revealed” effects of side quests cannot be
    canceled by player card effects. If a side quest is dealt to an enemy as a
    shadow card, it functions as any other encounter card without shadow text.
Enemy Cards:
  text: >
    Enemy cards represent the villains, creatures, monsters, and minions that
    attempt to capture, destroy, or mislead the heroes as they pursue their
    quest.

    ⦁ After an enemy card is revealed, it is added to the staging area.

    ⦁ Enemy cards remain in play until they are defeated or removed from play by a card ability.

    ⦁ If an enemy engages a player, it remains engaged with that player until it is defeated or removed from that player’s play area by a card ability.
Engaged:
  text: >
    When an enemy enters a player’s play area from another game location, that
    enemy has engaged that player, and that player has engaged that enemy.

    ⦁ An engaged enemy does not contribute its threat strength to the total threat strength of the staging area. Instead, each engaged enemy makes an attack during the combat phase.

    ⦁ An engaged enemy remains engaged with a player until it is destroyed, moved to another play area, or removed from play.
Engagement Check:
  aliases:
    - engagement
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to make an engagement check against an enemy in
    the  staging area, compare the player’s threat level to the engagement cost
    of the enemy. If the player’s threat level is equal to or greater than that
    enemy’s engagement cost, the enemy engages that player by moving it from the
    staging area to that player’s play area.
Enters Play:
  text: >
    The phrase “enters play” refers to any time a card makes a transition from
    an out-of-play area or state into play. Playing a card and putting a card
    into play by using a card ability are two different means by which a card
    may enter play.
Escape Test:
  aliases:
    - escape
  text: >
    To make an escape test, a player first commits characters to the test. A
    character must exhaust to commit to an escape test. Each
    committed  character counts its <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> strength
    for the test. After committing characters to the test, the players may take
    actions or play event cards. If a single player is required to make an
    escape test, only that player may commit characters he controls to the test.
    If the party is required to make an escape test, all players have the option
    of committing characters they control to the test.


    Once the characters are committed, a number of cards (as instructed by the card text dictating the escape test) are dealt from the encounter deck. Cards in the encounter deck may have a bold “Escape” value. Any  card that does not have a printed escape value is considered to have a base escape value of zero. When dealing cards for an escape test, ignore all other effects on the dealt cards. Once these cards are dealt, the total committed <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> is compared to the total  dealt escape value to determine if the escape test is passed or failed.


    If the total committed <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> is higher than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is passed, and nothing happens.


    If the total committed <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> is equal to or lower than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is failed, and the players follow the instructions for failing the escape test from the card that required the test be made.


    After an escape test, all cards dealt for that test are placed in the encounter discard pile.

Event Cards:
  text: >
    Event cards represent actions, spells, and other unexpected twists that
    might occur during the game.

    ⦁ An event card’s ability type, triggering condition (if any), and play permissions/restrictions (if any) define when and how the card can be played.

    ⦁ When a player plays an event card, its cost is paid, its ability is resolved, and the card is then placed in that player’s discard pile.

    ⦁ Event cards engage the game state at the time they are played and resolve. If an event card creates a lasting effect on the game state, only cards that are in play (or in the affected game area or game state) at the time the event card is played are eligible to be affected. Cards that enter play after the resolution of the event are not affected by its lasting effect.

    ⦁ If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and its cost remains paid. Only the effects have been canceled.

    ⦁ Unless the ability that puts it into play also changes its cardtype to a cardtype that is permitted in play, an event card cannot enter play.
Exhausted:
  text: >
    Cards are often exhausted in order to make an attack or use
    certain  abilities. When a card is exhausted, it is rotated 90 degrees.

    ⦁ An exhausted card cannot be exhausted again until it is ready. Cards are typically readied by a game step or card ability.

    ⦁ A card ability on an exhausted card is active and can still engage the game state. However, if an exhausted card must exhaust as part of the cost to use an ability, it cannot exhaust again, and therefore cannot be used to pay for the ability.,
Explored:
  text: >
    If the number of progress tokens on a location is equal to or greater than
    its quest points, that location is considered explored and is placed in the
    discard pile.

    ⦁ Placing a location in the discard pile by exploring it is not the same as discarding it.

    ⦁ If the active location becomes explored during quest resolution, place any remaining progress tokens on to the current quest.
First Player:
  aliases:
    - first player token
  text: >
    A first player is determined by the players at the beginning of the game.
    The first player token is used to indicate which player is the first player.
    At the end of each refresh phase, this token passes to the next player (the
    player to the left of the current first player) and that player becomes the
    first player for the next round.


    If the first player is eliminated, the first player token immediately passes clockwise to the next player.


    The players as a group are encouraged to work together and discuss each course of action during the game, but the first player has the final say with the following matters:

    ⦁ During the travel phase, the first player decides which location the players travel to.

    ⦁ If an encounter or quest effect targets a single player or card, and  there are multiple eligible targets, the first player selects the target  of the effect from among the eligible options.

    ⦁ If two or more effects trigger simultaneously, the first player decides the order in which to resolve them.


    The first player has timing priority in the following situations:

    ⦁ The first player has the first opportunity to initiate actions or act first in all standard action windows. Action opportunities then proceed among the remaining players in player order.

    ⦁ The first player has the first opportunity to initiate responses at each appropriate game moment. Response opportunities then proceed among the  remaining players in player order.
Forced:
  text: >
    Forced is a bold trigger word. If the word “Forced” precedes a triggered
    ability, the ability’s initiation is mandatory.

    ⦁ For any given triggering condition, forced responses take priority and initiate before nonforced responses of the same “when” or “after” type.

    ⦁ If two or more forced abilities would initiate at the same moment, the first player determines the order in which the abilities initiate,  regardless of who controls the cards bearing those abilities.

    ⦁ Each forced ability must resolve as completely as possible before the next forced ability to the same triggering condition may initiate.
Fortitude Tests:
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to make a Fortitude test, he may exhaust any
    number of heroes he controls to commit them to the test. Then, he must
    discard the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is the tens digit of
    his threat dial. If the total willpower of the heroes committed to the test
    is greater than the number of Sauron’s Eye icons on the encounter cards
    discarded for the test, that player successfully passes the Fortitude test.
    If the number of Sauron’s Eye icons is equal to or greater than the total
    willpower of the committed heroes, that player fails the Fortitude test. If
    the encounter deck is ever empty during a Fortitude test, shuffle the
    encounter discard pile into the encounter deck.


    Fortitude tests interrupt the regular turn sequence and create a new action window. After the total number of Sauron’s Eye icons on the discarded  encounter cards has been determined, players are allowed to take actions. Once the Fortitude test is resolved, play continues as normal and player  actions are restricted to regular action windows.
Gains:
  text: >
    The word “gains” is used in multiple contexts.

    ⦁ If a player gains resources, those resources are taken from the token bank and added to the specified hero’s resource pool.

    ⦁ If a card gains a characteristic (such as a trait, keyword, or ability text), the card functions as if it possesses the gained characteristic.  Gained characteristics are not considered to be printed on the card.
Grapple:
  text: >
    When an enemy with the Grapple keyword is revealed, or when you are
    instructed to resolve an enemy’s Grapple keyword, immediately attach that
    enemy facedown to the location in the staging area specified in parentheses
    (for example, the location with the highest
    <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545>, or the highest quest points). If more than
    one location meets the specified criteria, the first player may choose which
    of those locations the enemy grapples. If there are no locations in the
    staging area, add the enemy to the staging area without attaching it to any
    location. While attached to a location by the Grapple keyword, an enemy is
    “grappled with” that location.


    While grappled with a location, an enemy is not considered to be in the staging area, cannot be engaged, and is immune to player card effects. Instead, it adds 2 <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> to the <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> of the location it is grappled with. When a location becomes the active location, or when a location in the staging area is explored, any enemies grappled with that location are detached, flipped faceup, and added to the staging area as normal enemies.
Guarded:
  aliases:
    - guarded (x)
  text: >
    Guarded is a keyword ability. When an objective with the guarded keyword  is
    revealed, reveal the next card from the encounter deck and attach the card
    with the guarded keyword to it and place them both in the staging area. If
    the next card also has the guarded keyword, use the next card of the
    encounter deck to fulfill the original keyword effect, and then resolve the
    guarded keyword on the second card.


    When a card with Guarded (X) is revealed, instead of revealing the next card from the encounter deck, discard cards from the encounter deck until an encounter card with the matching type is discarded. Then, add it to the staging area and attach the just revealed objective to it. Once attached, an objective with Guarded (X) works just like an objective with the Guarded keyword.

        
    Enemy and location cards attached to guarded objectives do count their threat while in the staging area.


    While an objective has one or more encounter cards attached to it, it cannot be claimed. Once all attached encounter cards are dealt with, the objective remains in the staging area until it is claimed.


    An unguarded objective can be claimed in the manner specified by its card text.


    An encounter card attached to a guarded objective is dealt with in the following method, depending on its card type:

    ⦁ **Enemy**: The enemy leaves play, either by being defeated or as the result of a card effect.

    ⦁ **Location**: The location leaves play, either by being explored or as the result of a card effect.

    ⦁ **Treachery**: The treachery’s effects resolve, or are canceled.
Hero Cards:
  aliases:
    - hero
  text: >
    Hero cards represent the main characters a player controls in an attempt to
    complete a scenario. Heroes start in play, and they provide the resources
    that are used to pay for the cards (allies, attachments, and events) in a
    player’s deck.


    Heroes can commit to quests, attack, defend, and in many cases they bring their own card abilities to the game.

    ⦁ Each player chooses 1-3 hero cards and starts the game with them in play.

    ⦁ Hero cards remain in play unless destroyed or otherwise removed from play by a card ability.
Hide Test:
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to make a Hide test, that player may exhaust any
    number of characters he or she controls to commit those characters to the
    Hide test. Then, that player discards the top X cards of the encounter deck
    where X is equal to the Hide X value. Add the total
    <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> of the discarded cards and compare it to
    the total  :lotrwillpower: of the characters committed to the Hide test. If
    the total <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> of the discarded cards is greater
    than the total :lotrwillpower: of all characters committed to the Hide test,
    then that player fails the Hide test. If the total :lotrwillpower of the
    characters committed to the Hide test is greater than or equal to the total
    <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> of the discarded cards, then the Hide test
    is successful. After the Hide test resolves, characters are no longer
    committed to the test.


    Hide tests interrupt the regular turn sequence and create a new action window. After the total <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> of the discarded cards has been determined, players are allowed to take actions. Once the Hide test is resolved, play continues as normal and player actions are restricted to regular action windows.
Hide X:
  aliases:
    - hide
  text: >
    When an encounter card with the Hide X keyword is revealed, the player who
    revealed the card must make a Hide test. If the encounter card with the Hide
    X keyword also has a “When Revealed” or “Forced” effect, the Hide test must
    be resolved before resolving the rest of the card.
Hidden Cards:
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to take 1 hidden card, he or she takes the top
    card of the encounter deck and places it facedown in his or her play area
    without looking at it. If there are no cards in the encounter deck when a
    player is instructed to take 1 hidden card, the encounter discard pile is
    shuffled back into the encounter deck and the top card of the encounter deck
    is placed facedown in his or her play area.


    When a player is instructed to turn his or her hidden cards faceup, he or she turns each hidden card in his play area faceup one at a time. If a  player turns a hidden card faceup and it is an enemy, that player  immediately engages that enemy. If a player turns a hidden card faceup and it is a treachery or a location, he or she immediately discards that card.


    If a player is eliminated, any hidden cards in his play area are discarded.
Hinder:
  text: >
    While engaged with a player, an enemy with the Hinder keyword is not dealt a
    shadow card and does not make an attack during the combat phase.


    Instead of making attacks, enemies with the Hinder keyword force players to remove progress from the current quest or active location. At the beginning of the combat phase, each player removes one progress from the current  quest for each enemy with Hinder engaged with him. When there is no progress remaining on the current quest, players remove progress from the active location instead. If there is no progress on either the quest or active location, there is no effect.
Hit Points:
  text: >
    Each character and enemy has a hit point value. If a character or enemy has
    as much or more damage on it as it has hit points, it is destroyed.
Immune:
  aliases:
    - immune to player card effects
    - immune to player cards
    - immune to ranged damage
    - immune to range damage
    - immune to ranged
    - immune to damage
    - immune to card effects
  text: >
    If a card is immune to a specified set of effects, it cannot be chosen as
    the target for or affected by effects that belong to that set.

    ⦁ Immunity only protects the immune card itself. Peripheral entities (such as attachments, tokens on the card, and abilities that originate from the immune card) are not themselves immune.

    ⦁ If a card gains immunity, pre-existing lasting effects that have been applied to the card are recalculated to account for the immunity.
In Play and Out of Play:
  aliases:
    - in play
    - out of play
  text: >
    Faceup cards in the staging area or a player’s play area are considered “in
    play.” Additionally, the top card of the quest deck and the active location
    are also in play.


    “Out of play” refers to the cards in a player’s hand, deck, and discard pile, the encounter deck, encounter discard pile, cards in the victory display, cards set aside, and cards removed from the game.

    ⦁ Card abilities only interact with, and can only target, cards that are in play, unless the ability text specifically refers to an out-of-play area.

    ⦁ Card abilities can only be initiated or affect the game from an in-play area unless they specifically refer to being used from an out-of-play area, or require that the card be out of play for the ability to resolve. Play restrictions and permissions are an exception that may affect how a card may or may not be deployed or used.

    ⦁ A card enters play when it moves from an out-ofplay origin to a play area.

    ⦁ A card leaves play when it moves from a play area to an out-of-play destination.
In Player Order:
  aliases:
    - player order
  text: >
    If players are instructed to perform a sequence “in player order,” the first
    player performs his or her part of the sequence first, followed by the other
    players in clockwise order.

    ⦁ If a sequence performed in player order does not conclude after each player has performed his or her aspect of the sequence once, the sequence of opportunities continues to proceed in a clockwise manner until it is complete.

    ⦁ The phrase “next player” always refers to the next (clockwise) player in player order.
Indestructible:
  text: >
    An enemy with the Indestructible keyword cannot be destroyed by damage, even
    when it has damage on it equal to its hit points.


    Indestructible was introduced in the Shadow and Flame scenario.
Initial Threat Level:
  text: >
    A player’s initial threat level is the combined threat cost of each hero
    under that player’s control.
Joining Another Player:
  text: >
    Joining another player happens at the beginning of the travel phase. The
    joining player(s) must add any encounter cards in his or her own staging
    area to the staging area of the player(s) he or she is joining with, keeping
    any enemies engaged with him or her and discarding any active location in
    the staging area being left. If multiple players complete their current
    quest card during the same phase, they join quests starting with the First
    Player and proceeding clockwise around the table.
Keywords:
  text: >
    A keyword is an attribute which conveys specific rules to its card. The
    keywords are: Doomed, Guarded, Ranged, Restricted, Sentinel, Surge,  and
    Victory.

    ⦁ Some keywords are followed by reminder text, which is presented in italics. Reminder text is a shorthand explanation of how a keyword works, but it is not rules text and does not replace the rules for that keyword in this glossary.

    ⦁ If a card gains multiple instances of a numerative keyword, each instance stacks. *For example, if a treachery card with Doomed 2 gains Dooomed 1 from another source when it is revealed, it will have a total  of Doomed 3.*
Last Player:
  text: >
    Some cards refer to the “last player.” The last player is considered to be
    the player sitting directly to the right of the first player. If there is
    only one player playing, then that player is considered to be both the first
    and last player
Lasting Effects:
  text: >
    Some card abilities create effects or conditions that affect the game state
    for a specified duration (such as “until the end of the phase” or “until the
    end of this attack”). Such effects are known as  lasting effects.

    ⦁ A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it, for a duration specified by the effect. The effect continues to affect the game state for the specified duration whether or not the card that created the lasting effect is or remains in play.

    ⦁ If a lasting effect generated by a player card affects in-play cards (or a specified set of cards), it is only applied to cards that are  in play (or that meet the specifications of the set) at the time the lasting effect is established. Cards that enter play (or change status to meet the criteria of the specified set) after a lasting effect’s establishment are not subsequently affected by that lasting effect.

    ⦁ If a lasting effect generated by an encounter card or quest card affects in-play cards (or a specified set of cards), it is applied to all cards that meet its criteria regardless of their play-state at the time the lasting effect is established. Cards that enter play (or change status to meet the criteria of the specified set) after a lasting effect’s establishment are subsequently affected by that lasting effect the same as cards that are in-play at the time of its establishment. This aids the encounter deck’s ability to create effective card combinations.

    ⦁ A lasting effect expires as soon as the timing point specified by its duration is reached. This means that an “until the end of the round” lasting effect expires just before an “at the end of the round” ability or delayed effect may initiate.

    ⦁ A lasting effect that expires at the end of a specified time period can only be initiated during that time period.
Limits:
  text: >
    “Limit X per phase” is a limit that appears on some player cards. These
    limits are card specific. Each copy of an ability with such a limit may be
    used X times per phase, per instance of that ability.


    “Limit X per game” is a limit that appears on some player cards. These limits are player specific. Each copy of an ability with such a limit  may only be used X times per game by a player, regardless of which card is used to trigger that effect.

    ⦁ If an effect with a limit is canceled, the card is still considered to have been played or the ability initiated, and it counts towards the limit.
Locate Test:
  aliases:
    - locate
  text: >
    A locate test is made by a single player, as specified by the
    card  initiating the test. The player making the locate test may choose and
    discard 1 card from his or her hand to discard the top card of the encounter
    deck. If the discarded encounter card has “PASS” printed in its text box,
    then the test succeeds, and no ill effects trigger. If the card does not
    have “PASS” printed in its text box, then the player has not succeeded, but
    may attempt the test again, repeating this action until either the test is
    successful or he or she no longer wishes (*or is able to*) discard more
    cards. If a player runs out of cards or declares that he or she is not
    willing to discard any more cards to the test, then the test is  considered
    a failure, and players should follow the rest of the instructions on the
    card that initiated the test.
Location Cards:
  text: >
    Location cards represent the perilous places to which the player may travel
    during a scenario.

    ⦁ After a location is revealed, it is added to the staging area.

    ⦁ Location cards remain in play until they are explored.

    ⦁ If the players travel to a location, it becomes the active location.
Lost Effects:
  text: >
    Some cards have “Lost:” effects on them. These effects are only triggered by
    other card effects, and are not tied to any timing structure or phase of the
    game.
Master:
  text: >
    Cards with the Master trait represent the power of The Master Ring, and can
    only be used by the player who controls The One Ring. Cards with the Master
    trait cannot be used when playing saga expansions.
May:
  text: >
    The word “may” indicates that a specified player has the option to do that
    which follows. If no player is specified, the option is granted to the
    controller of the card with the ability in question.
Mire X:
  aliases:
    - mire
  text: >
    At the end of the refresh phase, place 1 resource token on each location in
    the staging area. Resource tokens placed on locations with the mire keyword
    are called “mire tokens.” When a location with the mire keyword has mire
    tokens equal to its mire X value, it is immediately discarded.


    Each location with the mire keyword also has a Forced effect that triggers when it is discarded from play by the mire keyword. These Forced effects do not trigger when a location is discarded by any other effect, or when a location is placed in the discard pile after being explored.
Modifiers:
  text: >
    The game state constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the count of any
    variable quantity that is being modified.


    Any time a new modifier is applied (or removed), the entire quantity is recalculated from the start, considering the unmodified base value and all active modifiers.

    ⦁ The calculation of a value treats all modifiers as being applied  simultaneously. However, while performing the calculation, all additive and subtractive modifiers should be calculated before doubling and/or halving modifiers are calculated.

    ⦁ If a value is “set” to a specific number, the set modifier overrides all non-set modifiers. If multiple set modifiers are in conflict, the most recently resolved set modifier takes precedence.

    ⦁ After all active modifiers have been taken into account, if a value  is below 0, it is treated as 0: a card cannot have “negative” icons, attributes, traits, cost, or keywords.

    ⦁ Fractional values are rounded up after all modifiers have been applied.
Move:
  text: >
    Some abilities allow players to move game elements, such as damage, cards,
    or tokens.

    ⦁ When an entity “moves,” it cannot move to its same (current) placement. If there is no valid destination for a move, the move attempt cannot initiate.
Mulligan Draw:
  aliases:
    - mulligan
  text: >
    After a player draws their starting hand during setup, that player has the
    option to declare a mulligan draw. After doing so, the player reshuffles the
    starting hand into his or her deck and draws a new starting hand. The player
    must keep this second hand.
Multiple Defenders:
  text: >
    Some card abilities allow players to declare multiple defenders for
    an  attack.

    ⦁ Pool the defense strength of each defender while resolving the attack.

    ⦁ The defending player must assign all damage from the attack to a single character that was involved in defending.
Neutral Cards:
  text: >
    Neutral cards do not belong to a sphere of influence.

    ⦁ A player may pay for neutral cards with resources from any of his or her heroes’ pools.

    ⦁ A player may combine resources from heroes that belong to different  spheres of influence to pay for a neutral card.
Next Player:
  text: >
    The term “next player” always refers to the next clockwise player (from the
    current active player, or from the player who most recently  performed a
    game function or passed) in player order.


    In a single-player game there is no next player and card effects that target the next player will not trigger.
Objective Cards:
  text: >
    Objective cards represent a range of different elements from the goal of a
    scenario, from allies who assist the players, to keys that allow the players
    to advance to the next stage of the quest, to artifacts  that are necessary
    to overcome a particular challenge.
        
    ⦁ After an objective is revealed, it is added to the staging area.

    ⦁ Objective cards remain in play unless the game instructs the players  to remove them from play.

    ⦁ The encounter deck has control of the objective. If a player claims  an objective, then that player gains control of that objective.
The One Ring:
  text: >
    The One Ring has Setup text that instructs you to attach it to a hero you
    control. This is done immediately after placing your starting heroes in your
    play area. If two or more players have The One Ring in their decks, the
    first player decides which player will put his copy of  The One Ring into
    play. Each other copy is removed from the game.


    The One Ring is immune to non-Master card effects.
Optional Engagement:
  text: >
    During the optional engagement step of the encounter phase (framework  step
    5.2), each player has the option to engage one enemy in the staging area.
    This is called “optionally engaging an enemy.”

    ⦁ Each player has one chance to optionally engage an enemy during the optional engagement step.

    ⦁ An enemy’s engagement cost has no bearing on optional engagements.
Ownership and Control:
  aliases:
    - ownership
    - control
  text: >
    A card’s owner is the player whose deck held the card at the start of the
    game. The scenario is considered to be the owner of the encounter deck and
    each encounter card.

    ⦁ By default, cards enter play under their owner’s control. Encounter cards are considered to be under the control of the scenario.

    ⦁ A card’s controller is the player who currently controls the card. Some abilities may cause cards to change control during a game.

    ⦁ A player controls the cards in his or her out-of-play game areas (such as the hand, the deck, and the discard pile).

    ⦁ If a card that has changed control leaves play, after the resolution of  the game occurrence that drives it from play, the card is physically  placed in its owner’s equivalent out of play area (hand, deck, or discard  pile). Other card abilities cannot interact with this secondary physical  placement.

    ⦁ When a character changes control while it is in play, it remains in the same state it was in before (i.e., readied or exhausted, damaged or not, etc.) and is moved to its new controller’s play area.

    ⦁ Attachments on a card that changes control also change control to the same new controller.

    ⦁ Unless a duration is specified, a control change persists as long as the  card remains in play.
Peril:
  text: >
    When a player reveals an encounter card with the Peril keyword, he or she
    must resolve the staging of that card on his or her own without conferring
    with the other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger
    any responses during the resolution of that card's staging.
Permanent:
  text: >
    Once a boon or burden with the permanent keyword is earned, it is attached
    to a hero and that choice is recorded in the Campaign Log. A card with the
    permanent keyword can only be attached to one hero for the duration of a
    campaign. Attachments with the permanent keyword cannot be discarded from
    the attached hero while that hero is in play. If a hero leaves
    play,  attachments with the permanent keyword attached to that hero are
    removed from the game.
Phantom:
  text: >
    During the ‘determine combat damage’ step of an attack made by an enemy with
    Phantom, if any damage would be dealt by the attack it is canceled and the
    defending player raises his threat by an equal amount instead.
Planning Phase:
  page: 22
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to play cards are described in timing
    entries 2.1–2.4.
Play and Put into Play:
  aliases:
    - play
    - put into play
  text: >
    Playing a card involves paying the card’s resource cost and placing
    the  card in the play area. This causes the card to enter play (or, in the
    case of an event card, to resolve its ability and be placed in the discard
    pile). Cards are played from a player’s hand.


    Some abilities cause cards to be put into play. This bypasses the need to pay the card’s cost, as well as any restrictions or prohibitions regarding  the potential of playing that card. A card that is put into play enters play in its controller’s play area.

    ⦁ A card that is put into play is not considered to have been played.

    ⦁ In order to play a card, its cost (after modifiers) must be paid.

    ⦁ When a card is put into play, its resource cost is ignored.

    ⦁ Unless otherwise instructed by the put into play effect, cards that  enter play in this manner must do so in a play area or state that matches the rules of playing the card.

    ⦁ When an event card is played, place it on the table, resolve its ability, and place the card in its owner’s discard pile.
Play Restrictions and Permissions:
  aliases:
    - play restrictions
    - permissions
  text: >
    Many cards or abilities contain specific instructions pertaining to when or
    how they may or may not be used, or to specific conditions that must be true
    in order to use them.

    ⦁ In order to use an ability or play a card, all of its play restrictions must be observed.

    ⦁ A permission is an optional play restriction, which allows a player to play a card or use an ability outside the timing or specifications generally provided by the game rules.
Player Deck:
  text: >
    The player deck includes a combination of ally, attachment, and event cards
    shuffled into a deck from which a player draws his or her cards throughout
    the game
Player Elimination:
  text: >
    A player is eliminated from the game if all of his or her heroes are killed,
    if his or her threat level reaches 50, of if a card effect  forces his or
    her elimination.

    ⦁ When a player is eliminated, that player’s hand, all of the cards he or she controls, and his or her deck are placed in their owners’ discard piles. Any enemies engaged with that player are returned to the staging area, retaining any damage tokens that are on them.

    ⦁ When a player is eliminated, the remaining players continue to play the game, revealing one less encounter card during the quest phase now that there is one less player in the game.

    ⦁ If all players are eliminated, the game ends in a loss for the players.
Player Side Quests:
  parent: side quests
  text: >
    A side quest with a player card back is called a “player side quest.”
    A  player side quest is both a quest card and a player card, and can
    be  included in player decks. A player side quest can be played from a
    player’s hand during the planning phase by paying its cost. When a player
    side quest is played or enters play, it is placed in the staging area.
Printed:
  text: >
    The word “printed” refers to the text, characteristic, or value that is
    physically printed on the card.
Priority of Simultaneous Resolution:
  aliases:
    - resolution
  text: >
    If two or more effects with the same bold timing trigger would
    resolve  simultaneously, the first player determines the order in which the
    effects resolve.
Prowl X:
  aliases:
    - prowl
  text: >
    When an encounter card with the prowl keyword is revealed from the encounter
    deck, the players (as a group) must discard the specified number of
    resources from their heroes’ resource pools. If the players do not have
    enough resources to match the specified value, then they must discard as
    many resources as they can.
Qualifiers:
  text: >
    If card text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms, the qualifier
    applies to each item in the list, if it is applicable. *For example, in the
    phrase “each ready character and attachment” the word “ready” applies to
    both “character” and “attachment.”*
Quest Advancement:
  text: >
    Players immediately advance to the next stage of a quest as soon as they
    place a number of progress tokens equal to or greater than the number of
    quest points the current quest card has.

    ⦁ Additional progress tokens earned against the quest do not carry over to the next stage.
Quest Cards / Quest Deck:
  aliases:
    - quest deck
  text: >
    Each quest card represents one of the various stages of the quest
    the  players are pursuing in a scenario. Each quest card is a numbered step
    in a fixed, sequential order, arranged in a stack called “the quest deck.”
Quest Phase:
  page: 21-23
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to resolve the quest are described
    in  timing entries 3.1–3.5.
Race:
  text: >
    When a quest stage with the race keyword is defeated, it is not removed from
    play after it is defeated. Instead, the quest stage remains in play and all
    progress is removed from it at the end of the phase.
Racing X Tests:
  aliases:
    - racing tests
    - racing
  text: >
    Racing tests represent the heroes’ ability to drive their chariots over
    difficult and dangerous terrain. Succeeding at these tests will mean the
    difference between winning and losing the race. Each quest stage has a
    Forced effect that initiates a racing X test when that stage is defeated.
    When this happens, the first player commits a single character to the test
    by exhausting it. Then, the first player discards the top X cards of the
    encounter deck, where X is the total value of that character’s indicated
    attribute
    (<:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741>,  <:lotrattack:971732794491420672>, or
    <:lotrdefense:971732765810761758>). Some encounter cards have racing test
    results printed in their lower-right-hand corners. The results types are
    **STRAIGHT**, **TURN** and **WILD** (the **WILD** result counts as both a
    **STRAIGHT** and a **TURN** result). Each racing Test specifies which result
    and how many of that result the players need to discard in order to pass.
Ranged:
  text: >
    Ranged is a keyword ability. A character with the ranged keyword can be
    declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are  engaged
    with another player.


    A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust  and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack.
Ready:
  text: >
    Cards enter play in a ready state, positioned so that their controller can
    read their text from left to right.

    ⦁ If a player is instructed to ready an exhausted card, the card is returned to this ready state.
Reanimated Dead:
  aliases:
    - reanimate
    - reanimated
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to reanimate a card, place that card facedown in
    front of that player, as if it had just engaged that player from the staging
    area. Facedown cards that have been reanimated are called  “Reanimated Dead”
    and act as if they are Undead enemy cards with 0 engagement cost, 2
    <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545>, 2 <:lotrattack:971732794491420672>, 2
    <:lotrdefense:971732765810761758>, and 2 hit points. If a Reanimated Dead is
    destroyed or leaves play for any other reason, it is placed in its owner’s
    discard pile.
Refresh Phase:
  page: 25
  text: |
    The steps of this phase are described in timing entries 7.1–7.5.
Regenerate X:
  aliases:
    - regenerate
  text: >
    An enemy with the Regenerate keyword heals damage from itself equal to the
    specified amount each round. This takes place immediately following the
    passing of the first player token during the Refresh Phase, and occurs
    before player actions.
Removed from Game:
  aliases:
    - removed
    - remove from the game
  text: >
    “Removed from the game” is an out-of-play state. A card that has been
    removed from the game is set aside and has no further interaction with the
    game in any manner for the duration of its removal. If there is no specified
    duration, a card that has been removed from the game is considered removed
    until the end of the game.
Replacement Effects:
  aliases:
    - instead
  text: >
    A replacement effect is an effect that replaces the handling of
    one  resolution with a different means of handling that resolution. Most
    replacement effects are response abilities in the format of “when triggering
    condition would happen, do [replacement effect] instead.”  After all
    responses to the original triggering condition have resolved  and it is time
    to resolve the triggering condition itself, the  replacement effect resolves
    instead.

    ⦁ If multiple replacement effects are initiated against the same  triggering condition, the most recent replacement effect is the one that is used for the resolution of the triggering condition.
Reset the Quest Deck:
  aliases:
    - reset the quest
    - reset quest deck
  text: >
    If the players are instructed to reset the quest deck, the players take the
    previously defeated quest card and return it to the quest deck as if they
    are just beginning that stage. Any progress tokens that were on the current
    quest are removed before the quest deck resets.  Progress tokens that were
    on the active location, however, remain on that location. All other cards,
    including those in the staging area, remain unchanged.
Resources:
  text: >
    Resources are the game’s currency and are used to pay for cards and card
    abilities.


    Resource tokens begin the game in the token bank. When a hero gains  resources transfer them from the token bank to the hero’s resource pool.  When a player spends resources from a hero’s pool, transfer them from the hero’s resource pool back to the token bank.
Resource Match:
  text: >
    In order for a player to play a card, he or she must pay for it by  spending
    resource tokens from the resource pool of a hero who has a resource icon
    that matches that card’s sphere of influence.


    ⦁ If a card is 0 cost and belongs to a sphere of influence, a resource match is still required to play that card.

    ⦁ Neutral cards do not require a resource match to play.
Resource Phase:
  page: 22
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to collect resources are described in timing
    entries 1.1–1.4.
Response:
  text: >
    Response abilities are labeled by the word “Response” followed by ability
    text. Unlike action abilities, which are resolved during action windows,
    response abilities may be executed after the specified triggering condition
    occurs, as described in the response’s ability text.

    ⦁ It is possible for multiple responses to be executed from the same triggering  condition.

    ⦁ When two or more response abilities share the same trigger, resolve all  response effects that use the word “when” before resolving response effects that use the word “after.”

    ⦁ A response ability is always used immediately after its triggering condition  has occurred and has been resolved. The first player always has the first  opportunity to use an ability in response to a given triggering condition,  followed by the next player, and so forth. Response opportunities for that  triggering condition alternate between between players in this manner until all players have passed consecutively.    

    ⦁ Once the opportunity to react to a triggering condition has been passed by all players, further responses to that specific triggering condition cannot be used.
Restricted:
  text: >
    Restricted is a keyword ability. Each character cannot have more than
    2  attachments with the restricted keyword.


    If a third restricted attachment is ever attached to a character, one of the restricted attachments must immediately be moved to its owner’s discard pile.
Reveal:
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to reveal an encounter card, the player takes
    the top card of the encounter deck, turns it faceup, and resolves the
    staging of that card, including any keywords and “when revealed” effects.
Running out of Cards:
  text: >
    If a player runs out of cards in his or her player deck, that player
    continues to play the game with the cards he or she has in play and in his
    or her hand. The player does not reshuffle his or her discard pile.


    If the encounter deck is ever out of cards during the quest phase, the encounter discard pile is shuffled and reset back into the encounter deck.
Running out of Tokens:
  text: >
    There is no limit to the number of resource, damage, or progress tokens
    which can be in the play area at a given time.


    If players run out of the provided resource, damage, or progress tokens, other tokens or coins may be used to track the current game state.
Safe:
  text: >
    When players travel to a location with the safe keyword, immediately return
    all engaged enemies to the staging area. While a location with the safe
    keyword is the active location, ignore the “when revealed” effects of all
    treachery cards, treat the printed text box of all encounter side quests as
    if they were blank, and enemies do not make engagement checks. At the end of
    the quest phase, if a safe location is the active location, add it to the
    victory display.
Sailing:
  aliases:
    - sailing tests
  text: >
    At the beginning of each quest phase (before committing characters to the
    quest), if the main quest has the Sailing keyword, the first player must
    perform a Sailing test.


    In order to perform a Sailing test, you must first shift your heading off-course. This represents the shifting of the winds, and the difficulty of navigating at sea. (If it is already at <:lotrheading270:975422082076778576>, it does not change.)


    Then, the player performing the Sailing test exhausts any number of characters he or she controls, committing them to the Sailing test. After choosing which characters to commit to the Sailing test, that player  ooks at a number of cards from the top of the encounter deck equal to the total number of characters committed to the Sailing test. If the encounter deck does not contain enough cards to look at, shuffle the encounter discard pile back into the encounter deck first.


    Some encounter cards have a <:lotrsailing:975421014597066752> symbol on the bottom left corner of their text box. This symbol represents a success when performing a Sailing test. For each <:lotrsailing:975421014597066752> symbol found on the looked at encounter cards, you may shift your heading on-course. If no <:lotrsailing:975421014597066752> symbols are found, your heading stays the same. Then, discard all of the looked at cards.


    <:lotrsailing:975421014597066752> symbols have no effect other than representing success during a Sailing test.


    Players have the opportunity to use Action effects before and after a Sailing test, but not during.
Scour:
  text: >
    The scour keyword does nothing by itself, but when the players are
    instructed by quest card or encounter card text to trigger a scour effect
    they must resolve the effect that follows the scour keyword on that card.
    The effect  that follows the scour keyword on a card is called the “scour
    effect.”
Search:
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to search for a card, the player is permitted to
    look at each of the cards in the searched area.


    If the player finds a card that meets the eligibility requirements being  searched for, the player may add that card to the game area indicated by the instructions on the search effect.

    ⦁ Cards in the process of being searched are not considered to leave the searched  area.
Secrecy X:
  aliases:
    - secrecy x
  text: >
    Secrecy lowers the cost to play the card by the specified value, provided
    the threat of the player who is playing the card is 20 or below. Secrecy
    only applies when the card is played from hand, and never modifies the
    printed cost of the card.


    Secrecy was first introduced on player cards in the Dwarrowdelf Cycle.
Self-referential Abilities:
  text: >
    Self-referential abilities refer only to the card on which the ability is
    located, and not to other copies of that card.
Sentinel:
  text: >
    Sentinel is a keyword ability. A character with the sentinel keyword may be
    declared as a defender during enemy attacks that are made against
    other  players.


    A character may declare sentinel defense after the player engaged with the enemy making the attack declares no defenders.


    The defending sentinel character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to defend the attack.
Setup:
  text: >
    Setup occurs before the game begins. Card effects triggered during Setup are
    fully resolved. In order to setup the game, follow these 7 steps:

    **1. Shuffle Decks** – Shuffle all player decks and the encounter deck. Do not shuffle the quest deck.

    **2. Place Heroes and Set Initial Threat Levels** – Each player places their heroes in his or her play area, adds up the threat cost of the heroes he or she controls, and sets his or her threat dial at the same value. This value is that player’s initial threat level for the game.

    **3. Setup Token Bank** – Place the damage tokens, progress tokens, and resources tokens in a pile next to the encounter deck. All players take tokens from this bank as needed throughout the game.

    **4. Determine First Player** – The players determine a first player based on a majority group decision. If this proves impossible, determine a first player at random. Once determined, the first player takes the first player token and places it in front of him or her as reference.

    **5. Draw Setup Hand** – Each player draws 6 cards from the top of his or her player deck. If a player does not wish to keep this starting hand, that player may take a single mulligan.

    **6. Set Quest Cards** – Arrange the quest cards in sequential order, based  off the numbers on the back of each card. Stage 1A should be on top, with the numbers increasing in sequence moving down the stack. Place the quest deck near the encounter deck, in the center of the play area.

    **7. Follow Scenario Setup Instructions** – The back of the first quest card typically provides setup instructions for a scenario. Follow these  instructions before flipping the quest card.


    After completing these steps, players begin the game starting with the first game round.
Shadow Effects:
  aliases:
    - shadow
  text: >
    Some encounter cards have a secondary effect known as a shadow effect. These
    effects are offset from a card’s non-shadow text by the “shadow bar”
    graphic. They are also denoted by the bold italic  “***Shadow***:” trigger
    on the card.

    ⦁ Shadow effects only resolve when dealt as a shadow card during an enemy attack.
Ship-Enemies:
  aliases:
    - ship enemies
  text: >
    Ship-enemies function in the same way as enemies and are considered to be
    enemies for all purposes, with the following exceptions:

    ⦁ Attacks made by ship-enemies can only be defended by ship-objectives. Non-ship cards cannot defend against a ship-enemy.

    ⦁ If an attack made by a ship-enemy is left undefended, damage from that attack must be assigned to a ship-objective you control, instead of to a hero you control
Ship-Objectives:
  aliases:
    - ship objectives
  text: >
    Ship-objectives function in the same way as objective-allies and are
    considered to be allies (and characters) for all purposes, with the
    following exceptions:

    ⦁ Ship-objectives can only attack ship-enemies. Non-ship enemies cannot be attacked by a ship-objective.

    ⦁ Ship-objectives can only defend against attacks made by ship-enemies. Ship-objectives cannot defend against attacks made by non-ship enemies.
Side Quests:
  text: >
    Side quests represent secondary adventures that the heroes may undertake
    while pursuing the main goals of the quest deck. There are two kinds of side
    quests: those with encounter card backs and those with player card backs.
    Side quests are never considered to be a part of the quest deck. The top
    card of the quest deck is called the “ main quest.”    


    **Side Quests in play**


    While any side quest is in the staging area, it functions like a quest card with the following exception: when a side quest is defeated, the players do not advance to the next stage of the quest deck. Instead, the side quest is added the victory display.


    At the beginning of each quest phase, if there are one or more side quests  in the staging area, the first player may choose one to be the  “current quest” until the end of the phase instead of the quest card that is currently active via the quest deck. While a side quest is the current quest, any progress that the players make is placed onto that side quest  and any card effects that target the “current quest” target that side  quest. Progress must still be placed on the active location before it can be placed on a side quest. Any progress that is made beyond the current quest’s total quest points is discarded; do not place progress on any other quest card in play.


    See also: $list
Siege:
  aliases:
    - siege quest
  text: >
    If a quest card has the siege keyword, when characters are committed to that
    quest, they count their total <:lotrdefense:971732765810761758> instead of
    their total <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> when resolving the quest.
    Enemies and locations in the staging area still use their
    <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> in opposition to this quest attempt.
Spheres of Influence:
  aliases:
    - spheres
  text: >
    There are four different spheres of influence, as shown below.


    If a player card has a sphere of influence icon, then it belongs to that sphere of influence.

    <:lotrleadership:971732910786899970> Leadership

    <:lotrlore:971750795387240488> Lore

    <:lotrspirit:971750721001242705> Spirit

    <:lotrtactics:971750629997428746> Tactics
Staging:
  text: >
    Staging is the term used to describe the process of revealing an encounter
    card from the encounter deck, resolving its effects, and placing that card.


    The staging of each encounter card follows these steps:

    1. Reveal the encounter card by turning it faceup so that its game text is visible.

    2. Resolve any keywords and/or when revealed effects on the encounter card.

    3. Place the encounter card in the appropriate game area. If the revealed encounter card is an enemy, location, or objective it is placed in the staging area. If the revealed encounter card is a treachery card, it is placed in the encounter discard pile.
Staging Area:
  text: >
    The staging area is a unique element of the game’s playing field. It
    represents the potential dangers the players might face as they progress on
    their quest.

    ⦁ When an enemy, location, or objective is revealed, it is added to the staging area.

    ⦁ While a location is in the staging area, the players are not at that location. Each location in the staging area contributes its threat strength to the total threat strength in the staging area.

    ⦁ While an enemy is in the staging area, it is not engaged with a player. Each enemy in the staging area contributes its threat strength to the total threat strength in the staging area.
Surge:
  text: >
    Surge is a keyword ability. When an encounter card with the surge keyword is
    revealed, reveal 1 additional encounter card.


    If an encounter card has more than 1 instance of surge, reveal 1 additional encounter card for each separate instance.


    Resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving the staging of the encounter card.
Switch:
  text: >
    Some effects use the word “switch.” In order to resolve such an effect,
    switched items must exist on each side of the switch.

    ⦁ When switching values, a value of “0” may be switched, but a null entry for the pertinent value field cannot be switched.
Table Talk:
  text: >
    Players are permitted and encouraged to talk to one another during play, and
    to work as a team to plan and execute the best course of action. Players can
    discuss anything they would like, including cards in play and cards in their
    hand, but each player cannot look at cards in another player’s hand or tell
    other players what to do.
Then:
  text: >
    If the effect text of an ability includes the word “then,” the text
    preceding the word “then” must be successfully resolved (or be true) in full
    before the remainder of the effect described after the word “then” can be
    resolved.

    ⦁ If the pre-then aspect of an effect does successfully resolve, the resolution of the post-then aspect of the effect must also attempt to resolve.

    ⦁ If the pre-then aspect of an effect does not successfully resolve in full, the post-then aspect does not attempt to resolve.
Threat / Threat Dial:
  aliases:
    - threat dial
  text: >
    Threat represents the level of risk a player has taken on during a scenario.
    The threat dial is used to track a player’s threat level throughout the
    game.

    ◊ A player’s threat cannot be reduced below 0.
Threat Elimination Level:
  aliases:
    - threat level
    - elimination
  text: >
    The threat elimination level is the threat level at which a player is
    eliminated from the game.


    If a player’s threat level reaches 50, that player is immediately eliminated from the game.
Time X:
  aliases:
    - time
  text: >
    When a card with the Time X keyword is revealed, the players put X
    resource  tokens on that card. These tokens are called “time counters.” At
    the end of each refresh phase, remove 1 time counter from each card with the
    Time X keyword, if able. When the last time counter is removed, there will
    be a triggered effect that resolves on that card. Some encounter cards will
    also remove time counters, making it more difficult for the players to
    predict when they will run out of time
Timing of Ability Resolution:
  aliases:
    - timing
  text: >
    When multiple triggered abilities share the same trigger, they are resolved
    in the following order:

    1. Constant abilities

    2. Forced abilities

    3. Response abilities


    When determining the order of effect resolution among abilities within those categories, abilities that use the word “when” are resolved before abilities that use the word “after.”

    ⦁ If two or more effects would occur simultaneously, the first player decides the order in which the effects resolve.

    ⦁ Cancel abilities interrupt this timing structure and may only be played immediately whenever their trigger condition would be met.
To:
  text: >
    Many card abilities are presented in a “do X to do Y” construct. In such a
    construct, the “do X” aspect (preceding the word “to”) is considered a cost,
    and the “do Y” aspect (following the word “to”) is considered an effect.

    ⦁ If an ability’s cost is not paid, its effect cannot be resolved.
Toughness X:
  aliases:
    - toughness
  text: >
    An enemy with the toughness keyword reduces the amount of damage it takes by
    X each time it is assigned any amount of damage.
Traits:
  text: >
    Most cards have one or more traits listed at the top of the text box and
    printed in Bold Italics.

    ⦁ Traits have no inherent effects on the game. Instead, some card abilities reference cards that possess or lack specific traits.
Travel:
  text: >
    Some locations have a bold Travel cost. In order to travel to such a
    location, its Travel cost must first be paid.


    If the players cannot pay the Travel cost, then they cannot travel to that location.
Travel Phase:
  page: 23
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to travel to locations are described
    in  timing entries 4.1–4.3.
Treasure:
  text: >
    Treasure cards cannot be used in a player’s deck right out of the box.
    Instead, players must discover treasure cards in a scenario, after which
    they are able to use the discovered cards in later scenarios.


    A player is permitted to add a treasure card to his or her player deck before the game begins if both of the following conditions are met:


    1. The player has discovered the specific treasure card he or she wishes to use through game text in a previous scenario using the same group of heroes he or she is currently playing with.

    2. The specific treasure card belongs to a treasure set that is listed in the setup instructions for the scenario currently being played. The treasure set icon appears in place of a sphere icon on treasure cards, and can also  be used to identify which scenario it can be discovered in.


    Any treasure card that meets the above conditions can be added to a player’s deck during the setup of a scenario. No more than 1 copy of any treasure card, by title, can be added to a player’s deck. Treasure cards added to a deck do not count towards that deck’s 50 card minimum.
Triggered Ability:
  text: >
    A bold timing command, followed by a colon and the rest of the ability, is
    indicative of a triggered ability.

    ⦁ Action, response, forced, and when revealed abilities are triggered  abilities.

    ⦁ A triggered ability on a player card can only be initiated if its effect has the potential to change the game state on its own. This potential is assessed without taking into account the consequences of the cost payment or future responses to the effect.

    ⦁ Unless prefaced by the word forced, all action and response abilities are optional.

    ⦁ Forced abilities and when revealed abilities are triggered automatically by the game at the ability’s appropriate timing point.
Triggering Condition:
  text: >
    A triggering condition is specific occurrence that takes place in the game.
    On card abilities, the triggering condition is the element of the ability
    that references such an occurrence, indicating the timing point at which the
    ability may be used. The description of an ability’s triggering condition
    usually follows the word “when” or “after.”

    ⦁ If a single game occurrence creates multiple triggering conditions (such as a single attack causing a character to both take damage and be defeated), those triggering conditions are handled with a single response window in  which abilities that refer to any of the triggering conditions created by the occurrence may be used in any order.
Underworld X:
  aliases:
    - underworld
  text: >
    When a location with the underworld keyword enters play, take cards from the
    top underworld deck equal to the specified value and stack them facedown
    underneath that location.


    When a location leaves play, any facedown cards stacked underneath that location are revealed one at a time, and added to the staging area. If a card from the underworld deck would be discarded, it is placed in the encounter deck discard pile.


    If a location with underworld is revealed from the encounter deck and there are no cards left in the underworld deck, then the underwold keyword has no effect.
Unique Cards:
  aliases:
    - unique
  text: >
    The <:lotrunique:972670966394155008> symbol before a card’s title  indicates
    the card is “unique.” The players as a group may have only one copy of each
    unique card, by title, in play.

    ⦁ A player cannot play or put into play a unique card if a copy of that card is already in play.

    ⦁ If a unique version of a character enters play from the encounter deck and there is already a copy of that character under a player’s control, that player must discard the version he or she controls.
Unique Encounter Cards:
  text: >
    A unique encounter card cannot enter play if there is another copy of that
    card already in play. If this is the case, the card's effects are ignored
    and the encounter card is placed in the encounter discard pile.
Valour:
  text: >
    Actions and Responses with the Valour trigger, presented as “Valour Action"
    or “Valour Response,” can only be triggered by a player whose threat is 40
    or higher.


    If an event card has two effects, one with the Valour trigger and one without, you may only choose one of these two effects to trigger when you play the card. You may still only choose the effect with the Valour trigger if your threat is 40 or higher.
Venom:
  aliases:
    - unconscious characters
    - unconscious
  text: >
    When an enemy with the Venom keyword damages a character, that character’s
    controller must give it 1 poison. This is done by taking the top card of his
    or her deck and attaching it facedown to that character. Facedown
    cards  attached to characters are considered “poison.” Poison cards are
    Condition attachments, and characters with any number of poison attached are
    considered “poisoned.”


    When a character has a number of poison attached equal to its printed hit points, that character is immediately made unconscious. This is done by rotating the character card 180 degrees. After a character is made  unconscious, the attached poison cards are placed in their owner’s discard pile. Unconscious characters cannot quest, attack, defend, collect resources, trigger abilities, be poisoned, or ready (except by effects that target unconscious characters).


    When a card effect instructs a player to “ready an unconscious character,” that player chooses an unconscious character and rotates that character 180 degrees so that it appears in its ready position. That character is now ready and is no longer considered to be unconscious.


    If any number of poison is removed from a character, or that character leaves play, then those poison cards are placed in their owner’s discard pile.
Victory:
  text: >
    Victory is a keyword ability. When an enemy or location with the
    victory  keyword is defeated or explored, it is placed in the victory
    display instead of the encounter discard pile.


    The victory keyword appears on the lower right portion of a card and is not considered to be part of the card’s text box. Card effects that blank a  card’s text box do not blank the victory keyword.


    At the end of the game, victory points in the victory display are applied to the group’s score.
Victory Display:
  text: >
    Many game effects place cards in the victory display.

    ⦁ The victory display is open information and may be looked at by any player at any time.
Villagers X:
  aliases:
