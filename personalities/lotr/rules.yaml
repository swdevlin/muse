active player:
  title: Active Player
  text: >
    The phrase “active player” is used to refer to a player who is obligated to perform (or granted the option to
    perform) a specific game function during a framework step or special action window.
active location:
  title: Active Location
  text: >
    When the players travel to a location, it is removed from the staging area and placed next to the quest deck,
    causing it to become the active location.
        
    ⦁ There can only be one active location at a time. The players cannot travel if another location card is active.
    
    ⦁ The active location does not contribute its threat strength to the total threat strength in the staging area.
    
    ⦁ The active location acts as a buffer for the current quest. Any progress tokens that would be placed on the current
    quest are instead placed on the active location, up to that location’s quest points.
    
    ⦁ If the active location becomes explored by a game or card effect that requires the placement of multiple progress 
    on the quest (and the progress is instead being placed on the active location), the remaining progress created by 
    the effect is placed on the current quest.
ally cards:
  title: Ally Cards
  aliases:
    - ally
    - allies
  text: >
    Ally cards represent characters (friends, followers, creatures, and 
    hirelings) that assist a player’s heroes on the quest. Ally cards are 
    played from a player’s hand, and they remain in play until they are
    destroyed.
ally objective cards:
  title: Ally Objective Cards
  aliases:
    - ally objective
  text: >
    Ally objective cards revealed from the encounter deck during the quest
    phase enter the staging area as an objective. If players claim the objective,
    as instructed by the card text, the objective becomes an ally under control 
    of the first player. If the objective ally leaves play for any reason, it
    the card is placed in the encounter discard pile.
ambush:
  title: Ambush
  text: >
    When an enemy with the ambush keyword enters play, each player, starting 
    with the first player and proceeding clockwise, must make an engagement
    check.
    
    
    The engagement check is only made against the enemy that just entered
    play, and not other enemies that are in the staging area. If the enemy
    engages a player as the result of this effect, then no further engagement
    checks are made against it.
archery:
  title: Archery
  text: >
    While a card with the archery keyword is in play, players must deal damage
    to character cards in play equal to the specified archery value at the
    beginning of each combat phase. This damage can be dealt to characters under
    any player’s control, and it can be divided among the players as they see
    fit. If there is disagreement as to where to assign archery damage, the
    first player makes the final decision. If multiple cards with the archery
    keyword are in play, the effects are cumulative. Remember that <:lotrdefense:971732765810761758> 
    does not block archery damage.
Attachment Cards:
  title: Attachment Cards
  aliases:
    - attachment
    - attachments
  text: >
    Attachment cards represent weapons, armor, artifacts, equipment, skills, and conditions. When played, they
    are attached to (placed slightly overlapped by) another card or game element, and they tend to modify or
    influence the activity of the card or game element to which they are attached.
        
    ⦁ An attachment cannot enter play if there is no eligible card or game element to which it can attach.

    ⦁ There is no limit to the number of attachments that can be attached to a card or game element.

    ⦁ If the card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, simultaneously discard the attachment.

    ⦁ Play restrictions, such as “attach to a Gondor hero” are checked only at the time the attachment enters play.

    ⦁ A player has the option to play attachments by attaching them to another player’s character. When an
    attachment enters play attached to a character under another player’s control, that player gains control
    of the attachment.

    ⦁ An attachment card readies and exhausts independently of the card to which it is attached.
attack strength:
  title: Attack Strength
  text: >
    Each character and enemy has an attack strength. This value is the amount of damage that character or enemy
    deals when it attacks. Attack strength is denoted by the <:attack:971552111034761216> symbol.
battle:
  title: Battle
  aliases:
    - battle quest
  text: >
    If a quest card has the battle keyword, when characters are committed to 
    that quest, they count their total <:lotrattack:971732794491420672> instead
    of their total <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> when resolving the quest.
    Enemies and locations in the staging area still use their <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545>
    in opposition to this quest attempt.
blank:
  title: Blank
  text: >
    If an ability causes a card’s printed text box to be considered “blank,” that
    text box is treated as if it did not have any of its printed text. Text gained
    from another source is not blanked.

    ⦁ Included in a card’s text box are its abilities, keywords, and traits.

    ⦁ A card with a blank text box retains its flavor and/or story text.
burgle:
  title: Burgle
  text: >
    To make a burgle attempt, the first player must follow these steps:
    
    
    **Step 1** - When a card instructs the first player to make a burgle 
    attempt, he or she must discard cards from the top of the encounter deck
    until a card with a burgle effect is discarded. Read and resolve the
    burgle effect as outlined in steps 2 and 3.
    
    **Step 2** - The first player shuffles his deck and reveals the top card.
    If the first player has no cards left in his or her deck, then the burgle
    attempt automatically fails.
    
    **Step 3** - Each burgle effect instructs the first player to discard a
    number of cards that match either the revealed card’s sphere, type, cost,
    or a combination of those things. If the first player discards the required
    cards from his or her hand, the burgle attempt is successful. If the player
    cannot, the burgle attempt fails.
cancel:
  title: Cancel
  text: >
    Some card abilities (usually response abilities) can “cancel” other card or game effects. Cancel abilities
    interrupt the initiation of an effect, and prevent the effect from initiating. Because of this, cancel abilities
    have timing priority over all other abilities.
        
    ⦁ If an effect is canceled, that effect is no longer imminent, and further abilities (including cancels) cannot
    be initiated in reference to the canceled effect.
    
    ⦁ When the effects of an ability are canceled, the ability is still considered to have been used, and any costs
    have still been paid.
    
    ⦁ If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and it is still
    placed in its owner’s discard pile.
    
    ⦁ If the effects of a treachery card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been revealed, and it is
    still placed in the encounter discard pile.
cannot:
  title: Cannot
  text: >
    The word “cannot” is absolute, and cannot be countermanded by other abilities or effects.
cardtypes:
  title: Cardtypes
  aliases:
    - Card Types
  text: >
    The game’s cardtypes are: quest, enemy, location, treachery, objective, hero, ally, attachment, and event. Each of
    these card types, with a detailed card anatomy, is presented in Appendix I.
    
    If an ability causes a cardtype to change (such as an ally card becoming an enemy card), it loses all
    other cardtypes it might possess and functions as would any card of the new type.
character cards:
  title: Character Cards
  text: >
    Character cards represent the different companions who come together to complete each quest.
    Character cards are divided into 2 types: heroes and allies. Any ability that refers to
    a “character” refers to both types.


    Some abilities, however, may refer only to a particular type, or may exclude a type, based on
    the ability text.
        
    ⦁ Characters enter play ready, in a player’s play area, and under their owner’s control.
    
    ⦁ Characters remain in play unless they are destroyed or removed by a game step or ability.
choose:
  title: The word “Choose”
  text: >
    The word “choose” indicates that a game element (most often a card) must be chosen as
    the target of an effect.
    
    ⦁ The controller of an ability that uses the word “choose” chooses all targets for the effect unless
    otherwise specified by the card.
    
    ⦁ If there is no valid target for a targeting effect, the ability cannot be initiated.
clue objectives:
  title: Clue Objectives
  text: >
    In some scenarios, players are searching for Clue objective cards. Players should try 
    to find and claim as many copies of them as they can while playing the scenario.
    
    
    When one of these cards is claimed, its card text transforms it into a condition
    attachment, and it is attached to a hero committed to the quest, with text that returns
    the card to the top of the encounter deck if the attached hero is destroyed. 
    Additionally, if the attached hero is destroyed or leaves play for any other
    reason, the clue objective card is returned to the top of the encounter deck.
combat phase:
  title: Combat Phase
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to resolve attacks are described in timing entries 6.1–6.11 on page 26.
constant ability:
  title: Constant Ability
  text: >
    A constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text contains no boldface
    timing trigger defining its ability type. A constant ability becomes active
    as soon as its card enters play and remains active while the card is in play.
    
    ⦁ Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition (denoted by words
    such as “during,” “if,” or “while”). The effects of such abilities are active
    any time the specified condition is met.

    ⦁ If multiple instances of the same constant ability are in play, each instance affects the game
    state independently.
controlling locations:
  title: Controlling Locations
  aliases:
    - losing control of locations
  text: >
    To take control of a location, the first player removes all progress from
    the just explored location and places it in front of him or her in his or
    her play area instead of discarding it. Locations under any player’s
    control are still in play. Their game text is active and they can be
    affected by card effects.
    
    
    When a player returns a controlled location to the staging area, he or she 
    loses control of that location and removes all progress from it. If a
    player is eliminated from the game, each location controlled by that player
    is returned to the staging area
copy:
  title: Copy (of a card)
  aliases:
    - copy of a card
  text: >
    A copy of a card is defined by title: any other card that shares the same title is considered
    a copy, regardless of cardtype, text, artwork, or any other characteristic(s) of the card(s).
cost:
  title: Cost
  text: >
    A card’s resource cost is the numerical value that must be paid to play the card.
    
    
    Some abilities have a cost described in the ability text that must be paid in order to use the ability.
    
    ⦁ When a player is paying a cost, the payment must be made with cards and/or game elements that player controls.

    ⦁ If a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player paying the cost may only use game elements that are in his or her out-of-play areas.

    ⦁ If multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.

    ⦁ An ability’s cost cannot be paid if the resolution of its effect does not have the potential to change the game state.

    ⦁ The word “to” is used in ability text to distinguish a cost from an effect, in a “pay cost to resolve effect” format.
current quest:
  title: Current Quest
  text: >
    The “current quest” refers to the quest stage that the players are currently attempting to defeat.
damage:
  title: Damage
  text: >
    Damage tokens can be placed on character cards and enemies by attacks and by various abilities. If
    a character or enemy has as much (or more) damage on it as it has hit points, it is destroyed.
    
    
    The following process is used to deal damage:
    
    1. Determine the amount of damage to deal (including modifiers).

    2. Assign the damage to the target (character or enemy).

    3. Place the damage on the target (character or enemy).
defending player:
  title: Defending Player
  text: >
    When an enemy makes an attack against a player, or against a character controlled by a player, that player is
    the defending player.
    
    
    If another player declares a sentinel character as a defender, the player that the enemy is attacking is
    still the defending player. Card effects, including shadow card effects, that target 
    “the defending player” or “you” still target the player who the enemy is attacking.
    
    ⦁ If an enemy is attacking a specific character, the player who controls that character is the defending player.
defense strength:
  title: Defense Strength
  text: >
    Each character and enemy has a defense strength. This value is the amount of damage a character reduces an
    attack by when it defends, or the amount of damage an enemy reduces an attack by when that enemy is attacked.
    
    ⦁ Defense strength is denoted by the <:defense:971552214013333524> symbol.
delayed effects:
  title: Delayed Effects
  text: >
    Some abilities contain delayed effects. Such abilities specify a future timing point, or indicate a future
    condition that may arise, and dictate an effect that is to happen at that time.
    
    ⦁ Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after their specified timing point / future condition 
    occurs or becomes true, before reactions to that moment may be used.
    
    ⦁ When a delayed effect resolves, it is not treated as a new triggered ability, even if the delayed effect was
    originally created by a triggered ability.
destroy:
  title: Destroy
  aliases:
    - destroyed
  text: >
    When a hero or ally is destroyed, it is placed faceup on top of its owner’s discard pile.
    When an enemy is destroyed, it is placed faceup on top of the encounter discard pile.
    
    
    Placing a hero, ally, or enemy in the discard pile as the result of being destroyed is not the same as
    “discarding” that card.
discard pile:
  title: Discard Pile
  text: >
    Many game effects place cards in a player’s discard pile or the encounter discard pile.
    
    ⦁ Each player has his or her own discard pile, and the encounter deck also has its own discard pile.
    
    ⦁ When a card is discarded, it goes to the discard pile belonging to the card’s originating deck.
    
    ⦁ Each discard pile is open information and may be looked at by any player at any time.
    
    ⦁ The order of cards in a discard pile may not be altered unless a player
    is instructed to do so by a card ability.
    
    ⦁ If multiple cards would enter a discard pile simultaneously, the owner
    of the cards chooses the order in which those cards are placed in the
    discard pile.
does not stack:
  title: Does not Stack
  text: >
    While two or more effects that do not stack with one another are active, 
    only one of them will affect the game state.
doomed:
  title: Doomed X
  alias:
    - doomed x
  text: >
    Doomed is a keyword ability. If an encounter card with the doomed keyword 
    is revealed, each player must raise his or her threat by the specified value.
    If a player card with the Doomed X keyword is played or put into play, each
    player must raise his or her threat level by the specified amount.
drawing cards:
  title: Drawing cards
  aliases:
    - draw
    - card draw
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to draw one or more cards, those cards are drawn from the top
    of his or her deck.
    
    
    When a player draws two or more cards as the result of a single game step or card ability,
    those cards are drawn simultaneously.
    
    
    Drawn cards are added to a player’s hand.
    
    
    There is no limit to the number of cards a player may draw each round.
    
    
    There is no maximum hand size.
effects:
  title: Effects
  text: >
    A card effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of ability text printed on or gained by a card.
    A framework effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of a framework step.
    
    ⦁ Card effects might be preceded by costs, triggering   conditions, play restrictions, play permissions, and/
    or targeting requirements. Such elements are not   considered effects.
    
    ⦁ Once an ability is initiated, players must resolve as much of each aspect of the effect as they are able,
    unless the effect uses the word “may.”
    
    ⦁ When a non-targeting effect attempts to engage a number of entities (such as “draw 3 cards” or
    “search the top 10 cards of your deck”) that exceeds the number of entities that currently exist
    in the specified game area, the effect engages as many entities as possible.
    
    ⦁ The expiration of a lasting effect (or the cessation of a constant ability) is not considered to be
    generating a game state change by card effect.
    
    ⦁ If an ability instructs a player to select among multiple effects, an effect that has the potential to 
    change the game state must be selected.
encounter deck:
  title: Encounter Deck
  text: >
    The encounter deck contains the villains, hazards, places, and circumstances that stand between the
    players and the successful completion of their quest.
    
    ⦁ An encounter deck consists of enemy, location, treachery, and objective cards.
    
    ⦁ The contents of the encounter deck are determined by the scenario the players are attempting.
encounter phase:
  title: Encounter Phase
  page: 24
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to resolve engagement checks are described in timing entries 5.1–5.4.
enemy cards:
  title: Enemy Cards
  text: >
    Enemy cards represent the villains, creatures, monsters, and minions that attempt to capture,
    destroy, or mislead the heroes as they pursue their quest.
    
    ⦁ After an enemy card is revealed, it is added to the staging area.
    
    ⦁ Enemy cards remain in play until they are defeated or removed from play by a card ability.
    
    ⦁ If an enemy engages a player, it remains engaged with that player until it is defeated or removed from that
    player’s play area by a card ability.
engaged:
  title: Engaged
  text: >
    When an enemy enters a player’s play area from another game location, that enemy has engaged that
    player, and that player has engaged that enemy.

    ⦁ An engaged enemy does not contribute its threat strength to the total threat strength of the staging area.
    Instead, each engaged enemy makes an attack during the combat phase.
    
    ⦁ An engaged enemy remains engaged with a player until it is destroyed, moved to another play area, or
    removed from play.
engagement check:
  title: Engagement Check
  aliases:
    - engagement
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to make an engagement check against an enemy in the 
    staging area, compare the player’s threat level to the engagement cost of the
    enemy. If the player’s threat level is equal to or greater than that enemy’s
    engagement cost, the enemy engages that player by moving it from the staging area to that
    player’s play area.
enters play:
  title: Enters Play
  text: >
    The phrase “enters play” refers to any time a card makes a transition from an
    out-of-play area or state into play. Playing a card and putting a card into
    play by using a card ability are two different means by which a card may enter play.
escape test:
  title: Escape Test
  aliases:
    - escape
  text: >
    To make an escape test, a player first commits characters to the test. A
    character must exhaust to commit to an escape test. Each committed 
    character counts its <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> strength for
    the test. After committing characters to the test, the players may take
    actions or play event cards. If a single player is required to make an
    escape test, only that player may commit characters he controls to the
    test. If the party is required to make an escape test, all players have
    the option of committing characters they control to the test.
    
    
    Once the characters are committed, a number of cards (as instructed by the
    card text dictating the escape test) are dealt from the encounter deck.
    Cards in the encounter deck may have a bold “Escape” value. Any 
    card that does not have a printed escape value is considered to have a
    base escape value of zero. When dealing cards for an escape test, ignore
    all other effects on the dealt cards. Once these cards are dealt, the total
    committed <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> is compared to the total 
    dealt escape value to determine if the escape test is passed or failed.
    
    
    If the total committed <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> is higher than
    the total dealt escape value, the escape test is passed, and nothing
    happens.
    
    
    If the total committed <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> is equal to or
    lower than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is failed, and the
    players follow the instructions for failing the escape test from the card
    that required the test be made.
    
    
    After an escape test, all cards dealt for that test are placed in the
    encounter discard pile.

event cards:
  title: Event Cards
  text: >
    Event cards represent actions, spells, and other unexpected twists that might occur
    during the game.
    
    ⦁ An event card’s ability type, triggering condition (if any), and play
    permissions/restrictions (if any) define when and how the card can be played.
    
    ⦁ When a player plays an event card, its cost is paid, its ability is resolved, and the
    card is then placed in that player’s discard pile.
    
    ⦁ Event cards engage the game state at the time they are played and resolve. If an event
    card creates a lasting effect on the game state, only cards that are in play (or in
    the affected game area or game state) at the time the event card is played are eligible
    to be affected. Cards that enter play after the resolution of the event are not affected by its
    lasting effect.
    
    ⦁ If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been
    played, and its cost remains paid. Only the effects have been canceled.
    
    ⦁ Unless the ability that puts it into play also changes its cardtype to a cardtype that
    is permitted in play, an event card cannot enter play.
exhausted:
  title: Exhausted
  text: >
    Cards are often exhausted in order to make an attack or use certain 
    abilities. When a card is exhausted, it is rotated 90 degrees.
    
    ⦁ An exhausted card cannot be exhausted again until it is ready. Cards
    are typically readied by a game step or card ability.
    
    ⦁ A card ability on an exhausted card is active and can still engage
    the game state. However, if an exhausted card must exhaust as part
    of the cost to use an ability, it cannot exhaust again, and therefore
    cannot be used to pay for the ability.,
explored:
  title: Explored
  text: >
    If the number of progress tokens on a location is equal to or greater
    than its quest points, that location is considered explored and is
    placed in the discard pile.
    
    ⦁ Placing a location in the discard pile by exploring it is not the same
    as discarding it.
    
    ⦁ If the active location becomes explored during quest resolution, place
    any remaining progress tokens on to the current quest.
first player:
  title: First Player
  aliases:
    - first player token
  text: >
    A first player is determined by the players at the beginning of the game.
    The first player token is used to indicate which player is the first
    player. At the end of each refresh phase, this token passes to the next
    player (the player to the left of the current first player) and that player
    becomes the first player for the next round.
  
  
    If the first player is eliminated, the first player token immediately passes
    clockwise to the next player.
  
  
    The players as a group are encouraged to work together and discuss each
    course of action during the game, but the first player has the final
    say with the following matters:
    
    ⦁ During the travel phase, the first player decides which location the players travel to.
    
    ⦁ If an encounter or quest effect targets a single player or card, and 
    there are multiple eligible targets, the first player selects the target 
    of the effect from among the eligible options.
    
    ⦁ If two or more effects trigger simultaneously, the first player decides
    the order in which to resolve them.
    
    
    The first player has timing priority in the following situations:
    
    ⦁ The first player has the first opportunity to initiate actions or act first
    in all standard action windows. Action opportunities then proceed among the
    remaining players in player order.
    
    ⦁ The first player has the first opportunity to initiate responses at each
    appropriate game moment. Response opportunities then proceed among the 
    remaining players in player order.
forced:
  title: Forced
  text: >
    Forced is a bold trigger word. If the word “Forced” precedes a triggered
    ability, the ability’s initiation is mandatory.
    
    ⦁ For any given triggering condition, forced responses take priority and
    initiate before nonforced responses of the same “when” or “after” type.
    
    ⦁ If two or more forced abilities would initiate at the same moment, the
    first player determines the order in which the abilities initiate, 
    regardless of who controls the cards bearing those abilities.
    
    ⦁ Each forced ability must resolve as completely as possible before the
    next forced ability to the same triggering condition may initiate.
gains:
  title: Gains
  text: >
    The word “gains” is used in multiple contexts.
    
    ⦁ If a player gains resources, those resources are taken from the token
    bank and added to the specified hero’s resource pool.
    
    ⦁ If a card gains a characteristic (such as a trait, keyword, or ability
    text), the card functions as if it possesses the gained characteristic. 
    Gained characteristics are not considered to be printed on the card.
guarded:
  title: Guarded
  text: >
    Guarded is a keyword ability. When an objective with the guarded keyword 
    is revealed, reveal the next card from the encounter deck and attach the
    card with the guarded keyword to it and place them both in the staging area.
    
    
    If the next card also has the guarded keyword, use the next card of the
    encounter deck to fulfill the original keyword effect, and then resolve
    the guarded keyword on the second card.
    
    
    Enemy and location cards attached to guarded objectives do count their
    threat while in the staging area.
    
    
    While an objective has one or more encounter cards attached to it, it
    cannot be claimed. Once all attached encounter cards are dealt with,
    the objective remains in the staging area until it is claimed.
    
    
    An unguarded objective can be claimed in the manner specified by its card text.
    
    
    An encounter card attached to a guarded objective is dealt with in the following
    method, depending on its card type:
    
  
    ⦁ **Enemy**: The enemy leaves play, either by being defeated or as the result of a card effect.
    
    ⦁ **Location**: The location leaves play, either by being explored or as the result of a card effect.
    
    ⦁ **Treachery**: The treachery’s effects resolve, or are canceled.
hero cards:
  title: Hero Cards
  aliases:
    - hero
  text: >
    Hero cards represent the main characters a player controls in an attempt to
    complete a scenario. Heroes start in play, and they provide the resources
    that are used to pay for the cards (allies, attachments, and events) in a
    player’s deck.
    
    
    Heroes can commit to quests, attack, defend, and in many cases they bring
    their own card abilities to the game.
    
    ⦁ Each player chooses 1-3 hero cards and starts the game with them in play.
    
    ⦁ Hero cards remain in play unless destroyed or otherwise removed from play
    by a card ability.
hidden cards:
  title: Hidden Cards
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to take 1 hidden card, he or she takes the top
    card of the encounter deck and places it facedown in his or her play area
    without looking at it. If there are no cards in the encounter deck when a
    player is instructed to take 1 hidden card, the encounter discard pile is
    shuffled back into the encounter deck and the top card of the encounter
    deck is placed facedown in his or her play area.
    
    
    When a player is instructed to turn his or her hidden cards faceup, he or
    she turns each hidden card in his play area faceup one at a time. If a 
    player turns a hidden card faceup and it is an enemy, that player 
    immediately engages that enemy. If a player turns a hidden card faceup
    and it is a treachery or a location, he or she immediately discards that
    card.
    
    
    If a player is eliminated, any hidden cards in his play area
    are discarded.
hit points:
  title: Hit Points
  text: >
    Each character and enemy has a hit point value. If a character or enemy has
    as much or more damage on it as it has hit points, it is destroyed.
immune:
  title: Immune
  aliases:
    - immune to player card effects
    - immune to player cards
    - immune to ranged damage
    - immune to range damage
    - immune to ranged
    - immune to damage
    - immune to card effects
  text: >
    If a card is immune to a specified set of effects, it cannot be chosen as the
    target for or affected by effects that belong to that set.
    
    ⦁ Immunity only protects the immune card itself. Peripheral entities (such as
    attachments, tokens on the card, and abilities that originate from the
    immune card) are not themselves immune.
    
    ⦁ If a card gains immunity, pre-existing lasting effects that have been
    applied to the card are recalculated to account for the immunity.
in play and out of play:
  title: In Play and Out of Play
  aliases:
    - in play
    - out of play
  text: >
    Faceup cards in the staging area or a player’s play area are considered
    “in play.” Additionally, the top card of the quest deck and the active
    location are also in play.
    
    
    “Out of play” refers to the cards in a player’s hand, deck, and discard
    pile, the encounter deck, encounter discard pile, cards in the victory
    display, cards set aside, and cards removed from the game.
    
    ⦁ Card abilities only interact with, and can only target, cards that are
    in play, unless the ability text specifically refers to an out-of-play area.
    
    ⦁ Card abilities can only be initiated or affect the game from an in-play
    area unless they specifically refer to being used from an out-of-play
    area, or require that the card be out of play for the ability to resolve.
    Play restrictions and permissions are an exception that may affect how a
    card may or may not be deployed or used.
    
    ⦁ A card enters play when it moves from an out-ofplay origin to a play area.
    
    ⦁ A card leaves play when it moves from a play area to an out-of-play destination.
in player order:
  title: In Player Order
  aliases:
    - player order
  text: >
    If players are instructed to perform a sequence “in player order,” the
    first player performs his or her part of the sequence first, followed
    by the other players in clockwise order.
    
    ⦁ If a sequence performed in player order does not conclude after each
    player has performed his or her aspect of the sequence once, the sequence
    of opportunities continues to proceed in a clockwise manner until it is
    complete.
    
    ⦁ The phrase “next player” always refers to the next (clockwise) player in
    player order.
indestructible:
  title: Indestructible
  text: >
    An enemy with the Indestructible keyword cannot be destroyed by damage,
    even when it has damage on it equal to its hit points.
    
    
    Indestructible was introduced in the Shadow and Flame scenario.
initial threat level:
  title: Initial Threat Level
  text: >
    A player’s initial threat level is the combined threat cost of each hero
    under that player’s control.
joining another player:
  title: Joining Another Player
  text: >
    Joining another player happens at the beginning of the travel phase.
    The joining player(s) must add any encounter cards in his or her own
    staging area to the staging area of the player(s) he or she is joining
    with, keeping any enemies engaged with him or her and discarding any
    active location in the staging area being left. If multiple players
    complete their current quest card during the same phase, they join
    quests starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise around
    the table.
keywords:
  title: Keywords
  text: >
    A keyword is an attribute which conveys specific rules to its card. The
    keywords are: Doomed, Guarded, Ranged, Restricted, Sentinel, Surge, 
    and Victory.
    
    ⦁ Some keywords are followed by reminder text, which is presented in
    italics. Reminder text is a shorthand explanation of how a keyword
    works, but it is not rules text and does not replace the rules
    for that keyword in this glossary.
    
    ⦁ If a card gains multiple instances of a numerative keyword, each
    instance stacks. *For example, if a treachery card with Doomed 2 gains
    Dooomed 1 from another source when it is revealed, it will have a total 
    of Doomed 3.*
last player:
  title: Last Player
  text: >
    Some cards refer to the “last player.” The last player is considered to
    be the player sitting directly to the right of the first player. If
    there is only one player playing, then that player is considered to be
    both the first and last player
lasting effects:
  title: Lasting Effects
  text: >
    Some card abilities create effects or conditions that affect the game
    state for a specified duration (such as “until the end of the phase”
    or “until the end of this attack”). Such effects are known as 
    lasting effects.
    
    ⦁ A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that
    created it, for a duration specified by the effect. The effect
    continues to affect the game state for the specified duration whether
    or not the card that created the lasting effect is or remains in play.
    
    ⦁ If a lasting effect generated by a player card affects in-play cards
    (or a specified set of cards), it is only applied to cards that are 
    in play (or that meet the specifications of the set) at the time the
    lasting effect is established. Cards that enter play (or change status
    to meet the criteria of the specified set) after a lasting effect’s
    establishment are not subsequently affected by that lasting effect.
    
    ⦁ If a lasting effect generated by an encounter card
    or quest card affects in-play cards (or a specified
    set of cards), it is applied to all cards that meet its
    criteria regardless of their play-state at the time
    the lasting effect is established. Cards that enter
    play (or change status to meet the criteria of the
    specified set) after a lasting effect’s establishment
    are subsequently affected by that lasting effect
    the same as cards that are in-play at the time of
    its establishment. This aids the encounter deck’s
    ability to create effective card combinations.
    
    ⦁ A lasting effect expires as soon as the timing point
    specified by its duration is reached. This means
    that an “until the end of the round” lasting effect
    expires just before an “at the end of the round”
    ability or delayed effect may initiate.
    
    ⦁ A lasting effect that expires at the end of a
    specified time period can only be initiated during
    that time period.
limits:
    title: Limits
    text: >
      “Limit X per phase” is a limit that appears on some player cards. These
      limits are card specific. Each copy of an ability with such a limit may
      be used X times per phase, per instance of that ability.
      
      
      “Limit X per game” is a limit that appears on some player cards. These
      limits are player specific. Each copy of an ability with such a limit 
      may only be used X times per game by a player, regardless of which card
      is used to trigger that effect.
      
      ⦁ If an effect with a limit is canceled, the card is still considered
      to have been played or the ability initiated, and it counts towards
      the limit.
locate test:
  title: Locate Test
  aliases:
    - locate
  text: >
    A locate test is made by a single player, as specified by the card 
    initiating the test. The player making the locate test may choose and
    discard 1 card from his or her hand to discard the top card of the
    encounter deck. If the discarded encounter card has “PASS” printed in its
    text box, then the test succeeds, and no ill effects trigger. If the card
    does not have “PASS” printed in its text box, then the player has not
    succeeded, but may attempt the test again, repeating this action until
    either the test is successful or he or she no longer wishes (*or is able to*)
    discard more cards. If a player runs out of cards or declares that he or she
    is not willing to discard any more cards to the test, then the test is 
    considered a failure, and players should follow the rest of the instructions
    on the card that initiated the test.
location cards:
  title: Location Cards
  text: >
    Location cards represent the perilous places to which the player may travel
    during a scenario.
    
    ⦁ After a location is revealed, it is added to the staging area.
    
    ⦁ Location cards remain in play until they are explored.
    
    ⦁ If the players travel to a location, it becomes the active location.
lost effects:
  title: Lost Effects
  text: >
    Some cards have “Lost:” effects on them. These effects are only triggered
    by other card effects, and are not tied to any timing structure or phase
    of the game.
may:
  title: May
  text: >
    The word “may” indicates that a specified player has the option to do
    that which follows. If no player is specified, the option is granted
    to the controller of the card with the ability in question.
modifiers:
  title: Modifiers
  text: >
    The game state constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the count
    of any variable quantity that is being modified.
    
    
    Any time a new modifier is applied (or removed), the entire quantity
    is recalculated from the start, considering the unmodified base value
    and all active modifiers.
    
    ⦁ The calculation of a value treats all modifiers as being applied 
    simultaneously. However, while performing the calculation, all
    additive and subtractive modifiers should be calculated before
    doubling and/or halving modifiers are calculated.
    
    ⦁ If a value is “set” to a specific number, the set modifier overrides
    all non-set modifiers. If multiple set modifiers are in conflict, the
    most recently resolved set modifier takes precedence.
    
    ⦁ After all active modifiers have been taken into account, if a value 
    is below 0, it is treated as 0: a card cannot have “negative” icons,
    attributes, traits, cost, or keywords.
    
    ⦁ Fractional values are rounded up after all modifiers have been applied.
move:
  title: Move
  text: >
    Some abilities allow players to move game elements, such as damage, cards,
    or tokens.
    
    ⦁ When an entity “moves,” it cannot move to its same (current) placement.
    If there is no valid destination for a move, the move attempt
    cannot initiate.
mulligan draw:
  title: Mulligan Draw
  aliases:
    - mulligan
  text: >
    After a player draws their starting hand during setup, that player has the
    option to declare a mulligan draw. After doing so, the player reshuffles
    the starting hand into his or her deck and draws a new starting hand.
    The player must keep this second hand.
multiple defenders:
  title: Multiple Defenders
  text: >
    Some card abilities allow players to declare multiple defenders for an 
    attack.
    
    ⦁ Pool the defense strength of each defender while resolving the attack.
    
    ⦁ The defending player must assign all damage from the attack to a single
    character that was involved in defending.
neutral cards:
  title: Neutral Cards
  text: >
    Neutral cards do not belong to a sphere of influence.
    
    ⦁ A player may pay for neutral cards with resources from any of his or her
    heroes’ pools.
    
    ⦁ A player may combine resources from heroes that belong to different 
    spheres of influence to pay for a neutral card.
next player:
  title: Next Player
  text: >
    The term “next player” always refers to the next clockwise player (from
    the current active player, or from the player who most recently 
    performed a game function or passed) in player order.
    
    
    In a single-player game there is no next player and card effects that
    target the next player will not trigger.
objective cards:
  title: Objective Cards
  text: >
    Objective cards represent a range of different elements from the goal
    of a scenario, from allies who assist the players, to keys that allow
    the players to advance to the next stage of the quest, to artifacts 
    that are necessary to overcome a particular challenge.
        
    ⦁ After an objective is revealed, it is added to the staging area.
    
    ⦁ Objective cards remain in play unless the game instructs the players 
    to remove them from play.
    
    ⦁ The encounter deck has control of the objective. If a player claims 
    an objective, then that player gains control of that objective.
optional engagement:
  title: Optional Engagement
  text: >
    During the optional engagement step of the encounter phase (framework 
    step 5.2), each player has the option to engage one enemy in the
    staging area. This is called “optionally engaging an enemy.”
    
    ⦁ Each player has one chance to optionally engage an enemy during the
    optional engagement step.
    
    ⦁ An enemy’s engagement cost has no bearing on optional engagements.
ownership and control:
  title: Ownership and Control
  aliases:
    - ownership
    - control
  text: >
    A card’s owner is the player whose deck held the card at the start of the
    game. The scenario is considered to be the owner of the encounter deck and
    each encounter card.
    
    ⦁ By default, cards enter play under their owner’s control. Encounter cards
    are considered to be under the control of the scenario.
    
    ⦁ A card’s controller is the player who currently controls the card. Some
    abilities may cause cards to change control during a game.
    
    ⦁ A player controls the cards in his or her out-of-play game areas (such as
    the hand, the deck, and the discard pile).
    
    ⦁ If a card that has changed control leaves play, after the resolution of 
    the game occurrence that drives it from play, the card is physically 
    placed in its owner’s equivalent out of play area (hand, deck, or discard 
    pile). Other card abilities cannot interact with this secondary physical 
    placement.
    
    ⦁ When a character changes control while it is in play, it remains in the same
    state it was in before (i.e., readied or exhausted, damaged or not, etc.) and
    is moved to its new controller’s play area.
    
    ⦁ Attachments on a card that changes control also change control to the same
    new controller.
    
    ⦁ Unless a duration is specified, a control change persists as long as the 
    card remains in play.
planning phase:
  title: Planning Phase
  page: 22
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to play cards are described in timing
    entries 2.1–2.4.
play and put into play:
  title: Play and Put into Play
  aliases:
    - play
    - put into play
  text: >
    Playing a card involves paying the card’s resource cost and placing the 
    card in the play area. This causes the card to enter play (or, in the case
    of an event card, to resolve its ability and be placed in the discard pile).
    Cards are played from a player’s hand.
    
    
    Some abilities cause cards to be put into play. This bypasses the need to
    pay the card’s cost, as well as any restrictions or prohibitions regarding 
    the potential of playing that card. A card that is put into play enters play
    in its controller’s play area.
    
    ⦁ A card that is put into play is not considered to have been played.
    
    ⦁ In order to play a card, its cost (after modifiers) must be paid.
    
    ⦁ When a card is put into play, its resource cost is ignored.
    
    ⦁ Unless otherwise instructed by the put into play effect, cards that 
    enter play in this manner must do so in a play area or state that
    matches the rules of playing the card.
    
    ⦁ When an event card is played, place it on the table, resolve its ability,
    and place the card in its owner’s discard pile.
play restrictions and permissions:
  title: Play Restrictions and Permissions
  aliases:
    - play restrictions
    - permissions
  text: > 
    Many cards or abilities contain specific instructions pertaining to when
    or how they may or may not be used, or to specific conditions that must
    be true in order to use them.
    
    ⦁ In order to use an ability or play a card, all of its play restrictions
    must be observed.
    
    ⦁ A permission is an optional play restriction, which allows a player to
    play a card or use an ability outside the timing or specifications
    generally provided by the game rules.
player deck:
  title: Player Deck
  text: >
    The player deck includes a combination of ally, attachment, and event cards
    shuffled into a deck from which a player draws his or her cards throughout
    the game
player elimination:
  title: Player Elimination
  text: >
    A player is eliminated from the game if all of his or her heroes are
    killed, if his or her threat level reaches 50, of if a card effect 
    forces his or her elimination.
    
    ⦁ When a player is eliminated, that player’s hand, all of the cards he
    or she controls, and his or her deck are placed in their owners’ discard
    piles. Any enemies engaged with that player are returned to the staging
    area, retaining any damage tokens that are on them.
    
    ⦁ When a player is eliminated, the remaining players continue to play the
    game, revealing one less encounter card during the quest phase now that
    there is one less player in the game.
    
    ⦁ If all players are eliminated, the game ends in a loss for the players.
printed:
  title: Printed
  text: >
    The word “printed” refers to the text, characteristic, or value that is
    physically printed on the card.
priority of simultaneous resolution:
  title: Priority of Simultaneous Resolution
  aliases:
    - resolution
  text: >
    If two or more effects with the same bold timing trigger would resolve 
    simultaneously, the first player determines the order in which the
    effects resolve.
prowl x:
  title: Prowl X
  aliases:
    - prowl
  text: >
    When an encounter card with the prowl keyword is revealed from the
    encounter deck, the players (as a group) must discard the specified
    number of resources from their heroes’ resource pools. If the
    players do not have enough resources to match the specified value,
    then they must discard as many resources as they can.
qualifiers:
  title: Qualifiers
  text: >
    If card text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms, the
    qualifier applies to each item in the list, if it is applicable. *For
    example, in the phrase “each ready character and attachment” the word
    “ready” applies to both “character” and “attachment.”*
quest advancement:
  title: Quest Advancement
  text: >
    Players immediately advance to the next stage of a quest as soon as they
    place a number of progress tokens equal to or greater than the number of
    quest points the current quest card has.
    
    ⦁ Additional progress tokens earned against the quest do not carry over
    to the next stage.
quest cards:
  title: Quest Cards / Quest Deck
  aliases:
    - quest deck
  text: >
    Each quest card represents one of the various stages of the quest the 
    players are pursuing in a scenario. Each quest card is a numbered step
    in a fixed, sequential order, arranged in a stack called “the quest deck.”
quest phase:
  title: Quest Phase
  page: 21-23
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to resolve the quest are described in 
    timing entries 3.1–3.5.
ranged:
  title: Ranged
  text: >
    Ranged is a keyword ability. A character with the ranged keyword can be
    declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are 
    engaged with another player.
    
    
    A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its
    owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are
    declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust 
    and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack.
ready:
  title: Ready
  text: >
    Cards enter play in a ready state, positioned so that their controller
    can read their text from left to right.
    
    ⦁ If a player is instructed to ready an exhausted card, the card is
    returned to this ready state.
refresh phase:
  title: Refresh Phase
  page: 25
  text: >
    The steps of this phase are described in timing entries 7.1–7.5.
regenerate x:
  title: Regenerate X
  aliases:
    - regenerate
  text: >
    An enemy with the Regenerate keyword heals damage from itself equal
    to the specified amount each round. This takes place immediately
    following the passing of the first player token during the
    Refresh Phase, and occurs before player actions.
removed from game:
  title: Removed from Game
  aliases:
    - removed
    - remove from the game
  text: >
    “Removed from the game” is an out-of-play state. A card that has
    been removed from the game is set aside and has no further
    interaction with the game in any manner for the duration of its removal.
    If there is no specified duration, a card that has been removed from the
    game is considered removed until the end of the game.
replacement effects:
  title: Replacement Effects
  aliases:
    - instead
  text: >
    A replacement effect is an effect that replaces the handling of one 
    resolution with a different means of handling that resolution. Most
    replacement effects are response abilities in the format of “when
    triggering condition would happen, do [replacement effect] instead.” 
    After all responses to the original triggering condition have resolved 
    and it is time to resolve the triggering condition itself, the 
    replacement effect resolves instead.
    
    ⦁ If multiple replacement effects are initiated against the same 
    triggering condition, the most recent replacement effect is the one that
    is used for the resolution of the triggering condition.
reset the quest deck:
  title: Reset the Quest Deck
  aliases:
    - reset the quest
    - reset quest deck
  text: >
    If the players are instructed to reset the quest deck, the players take
    the previously defeated quest card and return it to the quest
    deck as if they are just beginning that stage. Any progress tokens that
    were on the current quest are removed before the quest deck resets. 
    Progress tokens that were on the active location, however, remain
    on that location. All other cards, including those in the staging
    area, remain unchanged.
resources:
  title: Resources
  text: >
    Resources are the game’s currency and are used to pay for cards and card
    abilities.
    
    
    Resource tokens begin the game in the token bank. When a hero gains 
    resources transfer them from the token bank to the hero’s resource pool. 
    When a player spends resources from a hero’s pool, transfer them from
    the hero’s resource pool back to the token bank.
resource match:
  title: Resource Match
  text: >
    In order for a player to play a card, he or she must pay for it by 
    spending resource tokens from the resource pool of a hero who has a
    resource icon that matches that card’s sphere of influence.
    
    
    ⦁ If a card is 0 cost and belongs to a sphere of influence, a resource
    match is still required to play that card.
    
    ⦁ Neutral cards do not require a resource match to play.
resource phase:
  title: Resource Phase
  page: 22
  text: >
    The steps of this phase and how to collect resources are described in timing
    entries 1.1–1.4.
response:
  title: Response
  text: >
    Response abilities are labeled by the word “Response” followed by ability text.
    Unlike action abilities, which are resolved during action windows, response
    abilities may be executed after the specified triggering condition occurs,
    as described in the response’s ability text.
    
    ⦁ It is possible for multiple responses to be executed from the same triggering 
    condition.
    
    ⦁ When two or more response abilities share the same trigger, resolve all 
    response effects that use the word “when” before resolving response effects that
    use the word “after.”
    
    ⦁ A response ability is always used immediately after its triggering condition 
    has occurred and has been resolved. The first player always has the first 
    opportunity to use an ability in response to a given triggering condition, 
    followed by the next player, and so forth. Response opportunities for that 
    triggering condition alternate between between players in this manner until
    all players have passed consecutively.    

    ⦁ Once the opportunity to react to a triggering condition has been passed by all
    players, further responses to that specific triggering condition cannot be used.
restricted:
  title: Restricted
  text: >
    Restricted is a keyword ability. Each character cannot have more than 2 
    attachments with the restricted keyword.
    
    
    If a third restricted attachment is ever attached to a character, one of
    the restricted attachments must immediately be moved to its owner’s discard
    pile.
reveal:
  title: Reveal
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to reveal an encounter card, the player takes the
    top card of the encounter deck, turns it faceup, and resolves the staging of
    that card, including any keywords and “when revealed” effects.
running out of cards:
  title: Running out of Cards
  text: >
    If a player runs out of cards in his or her player deck, that player continues
    to play the game with the cards he or she has in play and in his or her hand.
    The player does not reshuffle his or her discard pile.
    
    
    If the encounter deck is ever out of cards during the quest phase, the encounter
    discard pile is shuffled and reset back into the encounter deck.
running out of tokens:
  title: Running out of Tokens
  text: >
    There is no limit to the number of resource, damage, or progress tokens which can
    be in the play area at a given time.
    
    
    If players run out of the provided resource, damage, or progress tokens, other
    tokens or coins may be used to track the current game state.
search:
  title: Search
  text: >
    When a player is instructed to search for a card, the player is permitted to
    look at each of the cards in the searched area.
    
    
    If the player finds a card that meets the eligibility requirements being 
    searched for, the player may add that card to the game area indicated by the
    instructions on the search effect.
    
    ⦁ Cards in the process of being searched are not considered to leave the searched 
    area.
secrecy:
  title: Secrecy X
  aliases:
    - secrecy x
  text: >
    Secrecy lowers the cost to play the card by the specified value, provided
    the threat of the player who is playing the card is 20 or below. Secrecy
    only applies when the card is played from hand, and never modifies the
    printed cost of the card.
    
    
    Secrecy was first introduced on player cards in the Dwarrowdelf Cycle.
self-referential abilities:
  title: Self-referential Abilities
  text: >
    Self-referential abilities refer only to the card on which the ability is located,
    and not to other copies of that card.
sentinel:
  title: Sentinel
  text: >
    Sentinel is a keyword ability. A character with the sentinel keyword may be
    declared as a defender during enemy attacks that are made against other 
    players.
    
    
    A character may declare sentinel defense after the player engaged with the
    enemy making the attack declares no defenders.
    
    
    The defending sentinel character must exhaust and meet any other requirements
    necessary to defend the attack.
setup:
  title: Setup
  text: >
    Setup occurs before the game begins. Card effects triggered during Setup
    are fully resolved. In order to setup the game, follow these 7 steps:
    
    **1. Shuffle Decks** – Shuffle all player decks and the encounter deck. Do
    not shuffle the quest deck.
    
    **2. Place Heroes and Set Initial Threat Levels** – Each player places their
    heroes in his or her play area, adds up the threat cost of the heroes he
    or she controls, and sets his or her threat dial at the same value. This
    value is that player’s initial threat level for the game.
    
    **3. Setup Token Bank** – Place the damage tokens, progress tokens, and
    resources tokens in a pile next to the encounter deck. All players take
    tokens from this bank as needed throughout the game.
    
    **4. Determine First Player** – The players determine a first player based
    on a majority group decision. If this proves impossible, determine a
    first player at random. Once determined, the first player takes the first
    player token and places it in front of him or her as reference.
    
    **5. Draw Setup Hand** – Each player draws 6 cards from the top of his or her
    player deck. If a player does not wish to keep this starting hand, that
    player may take a single mulligan.
    
    **6. Set Quest Cards** – Arrange the quest cards in sequential order, based 
    off the numbers on the back of each card. Stage 1A should be on top,
    with the numbers increasing in sequence moving down the stack. Place
    the quest deck near the encounter deck, in the center of the play area.
    
    **7. Follow Scenario Setup Instructions** – The back of the first quest card
    typically provides setup instructions for a scenario. Follow these 
    instructions before flipping the quest card.
    
    
    After completing these steps, players begin the game starting with the
    first game round.
shadow effects:
  title: Shadow Effects
  aliases:
    - shadow
  text: >
    Some encounter cards have a secondary effect known as a shadow effect.
    These effects are offset from a card’s non-shadow text by the
    “shadow bar” graphic. They are also denoted by the bold italic 
    “***Shadow***:” trigger on the card.
    
    ⦁ Shadow effects only resolve when dealt as a shadow card during an
    enemy attack.
siege:
  title: Siege
  aliases:
    - siege quest
  text: >
    If a quest card has the siege keyword, when characters are committed to
    that quest, they count their total <:lotrdefense:971732765810761758> instead
    of their total <:lotrwillpower:971731802047774741> when resolving the quest.

    <:lotrthreat:972109367790956545> in opposition to this quest attempt.
spheres of influence:
  title: Spheres of Influence
  aliases:
    - spheres
  text: >
    There are four different spheres of influence, as shown below.
    
    
    If a player card has a sphere of influence icon, then it belongs to that sphere of influence.
    
    <:lotrleadership:971732910786899970> Leadership
    
    <:lotrlore:971750795387240488> Lore

staging:
  title: Staging
  text: >
    Staging is the term used to describe the process of revealing an encounter card
    from the encounter deck, resolving its effects, and placing that card.
    
    
    The staging of each encounter card follows these steps:
    
    1. Reveal the encounter card by turning it faceup so that its game text is visible.
    
    2. Resolve any keywords and/or when revealed effects on the encounter card.
    
    3. Place the encounter card in the appropriate game area. If the revealed encounter
    card is an enemy, location, or objective it is placed in the staging area. If the
    revealed encounter card is a treachery card, it is placed in the encounter discard pile.
staging area:
  title: Staging Area
  text: >
    The staging area is a unique element of the game’s playing field. It represents
    the potential dangers the players might face as they progress on their quest.
    
    ⦁ When an enemy, location, or objective is revealed, it is added to the staging area.
    
    ⦁ While a location is in the staging area, the players are not at that location.
    Each location in the staging area contributes its threat strength to the total
    threat strength in the staging area.
    
    ⦁ While an enemy is in the staging area, it is not engaged with a player. Each
    enemy in the staging area contributes its threat strength to the total threat
    strength in the staging area.
surge:
  title: Surge
  text: >
    Surge is a keyword ability. When an encounter card with the surge keyword is
    revealed, reveal 1 additional encounter card.
    
    
    If an encounter card has more than 1 instance of surge, reveal 1 additional
    encounter card for each separate instance.
    
    
    Resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving the staging of the
    encounter card.
switch:
  title: Switch
  text: >
    Some effects use the word “switch.” In order to resolve such an effect,
    switched items must exist on each side of the switch.
    
    ⦁ When switching values, a value of “0” may be switched, but a null entry
    for the pertinent value field cannot be switched.
table talk:
  title: Table Talk
  text: >
    Players are permitted and encouraged to talk to one another during play,
    and to work as a team to plan and execute the best course of action.
    Players can discuss anything they would like, including cards in play
    and cards in their hand, but each player cannot look at cards in another
    player’s hand or tell other players what to do.
then:
  title: Then
  text: >
    If the effect text of an ability includes the word “then,” the text preceding
    the word “then” must be successfully resolved (or be true) in full before
    the remainder of the effect described after the word “then” can be resolved.
    
    ⦁ If the pre-then aspect of an effect does successfully resolve, the resolution
    of the post-then aspect of the effect must also attempt to resolve.
    
    ⦁ If the pre-then aspect of an effect does not successfully resolve in full,
    the post-then aspect does not attempt to resolve.
threat:
  title: Threat / Threat Dial
  aliases:
    - threat dial
  text: >
    Threat represents the level of risk a player has taken on during a scenario.
    The threat dial is used to track a player’s threat level throughout the game.

    eliminated from the game.
    
    
    If a player’s threat level reaches 50, that player is immediately eliminated
    from the game.
time x:
  title: Time X
  aliases:
    - time
  text: >
    When a card with the Time X keyword is revealed, the players put X resource 
    tokens on that card. These tokens are called “time counters.” At the end of
    each refresh phase, remove 1 time counter from each card with the Time X
    keyword, if able. When the last time counter is removed, there will be a
    triggered effect that resolves on that card. Some encounter cards will also
    remove time counters, making it more difficult for the players to predict
    when they will run out of time
timing of ability resolution:
  title: Timing of Ability Resolution
  aliases:
    - timing
  text: >
    When multiple triggered abilities share the same trigger, they are resolved
    in the following order:
    
    1. Constant abilities
    
    2. Forced abilities
    
    3. Response abilities
    
    
    When determining the order of effect resolution among abilities within those
    categories, abilities that use the word “when” are resolved before abilities
    that use the word “after.”
    
    ⦁ If two or more effects would occur simultaneously, the first player decides
    the order in which the effects resolve.
    
    ⦁ Cancel abilities interrupt this timing structure and may only be played
    immediately whenever their trigger condition would be met.
to:
  title: To
  text: >
    Many card abilities are presented in a “do X to do Y” construct. In such a
    construct, the “do X” aspect (preceding the word “to”) is considered a cost,
    and the “do Y” aspect (following the word “to”) is considered an effect.
    
    ⦁ If an ability’s cost is not paid, its effect cannot be resolved.
traits:
  title: Traits
  text: >
    Most cards have one or more traits listed at the top of the text box and
    printed in Bold Italics.
    
    ⦁ Traits have no inherent effects on the game. Instead, some card abilities
    reference cards that possess or lack specific traits.
travel:
  title: Travel
  text: >
    Some locations have a bold Travel cost. In order to travel to such a
    location, its Travel cost must first be paid.
    
    
    If the players cannot pay the Travel cost, then they cannot travel
    to that location.
travel phase:
  title: Travel Phase
  page: 23

    The steps of this phase and how to travel to locations are described in 
    timing entries 4.1–4.3.
Treachery Cards:
  title: Treachery Cards
  aliases:

  text: >
    Treachery cards represent traps, curses, maneuvers, pitfalls, and other
    surprises the players might confront during a scenario.
    
    
    When a treachery cards is revealed, its abilities are resolved immediately.
    After its abilities are resolved, it is placed in the encounter discard pile.
treasure:
  title: Treasure
  text: >
    Treasure cards cannot be used in a player’s deck right out of the box.
    Instead, players must discover treasure cards in a scenario, after
    which they are able to use the discovered cards in later scenarios.
    
    
    A player is permitted to add a treasure card to his or her player deck
    before the game begins if both of the following conditions are met:
    
    
    1. The player has discovered the specific treasure card he or she wishes to
    use through game text in a previous scenario using the same group of
    heroes he or she is currently playing with.
    
    2. The specific treasure card belongs to a treasure set that is listed in
    the setup instructions for the scenario currently being played. The treasure
    set icon appears in place of a sphere icon on treasure cards, and can also 
    be used to identify which scenario it can be discovered in.
    
    
    Any treasure card that meets the above conditions can be added to a player’s
    deck during the setup of a scenario. No more than 1 copy of any treasure
    card, by title, can be added to a player’s deck. Treasure cards added to a
    deck do not count towards that deck’s 50 card minimum.
triggered ability:
  title: Triggered Ability
  text: >
    A bold timing command, followed by a colon and the rest of the ability, is
    indicative of a triggered ability.
    
    ⦁ Action, response, forced, and when revealed abilities are triggered 
    abilities.
    
    ⦁ A triggered ability on a player card can only be initiated if its
    effect has the potential to change the game state on its own. This
    potential is assessed without taking into account the consequences of
    the cost payment or future responses to the effect.
    
    ⦁ Unless prefaced by the word forced, all action and response abilities
    are optional.
    
    ⦁ Forced abilities and when revealed abilities are triggered automatically
    by the game at the ability’s appropriate timing point.
triggering condition:
  title: Triggering Condition
  text: >
    A triggering condition is specific occurrence that takes place in the game.
    On card abilities, the triggering condition is the element of the ability
    that references such an occurrence, indicating the timing point at which
    the ability may be used. The description of an ability’s triggering
    condition usually follows the word “when” or “after.”
    
    ⦁ If a single game occurrence creates multiple triggering conditions (such
    as a single attack causing a character to both take damage and be defeated),
    those triggering conditions are handled with a single response window in 
    which abilities that refer to any of the triggering conditions created
    by the occurrence may be used in any order.
underworld x:
  title: Underworld X
  aliases:
    - underworld
  text: >
    When a location with the underworld keyword enters play, take cards from the
    top underworld deck equal to the specified value and stack them facedown
    underneath that location.
    
    
    When a location leaves play, any facedown cards stacked underneath that
    location are revealed one at a time, and added to the staging area. If
    a card from the underworld deck would be discarded, it is placed in the
    encounter deck discard pile.
    
    
    If a location with underworld is revealed from the encounter deck and
    there are no cards left in the underworld deck, then the underwold keyword
    has no effect.
unique cards:
  title: Unique Cards
  aliases:
    - unique
  text: >
    The <:lotrunique:972670966394155008> symbol before a card’s title 
    indicates the card is “unique.” The players as a group may have
    only one copy of each unique card, by title, in play.
    
    ⦁ A player cannot play or put into play a unique card if a copy of
    that card is already in play.
    
    ⦁ If a unique version of a character enters play from the encounter
    deck and there is already a copy of that character under a player’s
    control, that player must discard the version he or she controls.
unique encounter cards:
  title: Unique Encounter Cards
  text: >
    A unique encounter card cannot enter play if there is another copy of
    that card already in play. If this is the case, the card's effects
    are ignored and the encounter card is placed in the encounter discard pile.
venom:
  title: Venom
  aliases:
    - unconscious characters
    - unconscious
  text: >
    When an enemy with the Venom keyword damages a character, that character’s
    controller must give it 1 poison. This is done by taking the top card of
    his or her deck and attaching it facedown to that character. Facedown cards 
    attached to characters are considered “poison.” Poison cards are Condition
    attachments, and characters with any number of poison attached are
    considered “poisoned.”
    
    
    When a character has a number of poison attached equal to its printed hit
    points, that character is immediately made unconscious. This is done by
    rotating the character card 180 degrees. After a character is made 
    unconscious, the attached poison cards are placed in their owner’s discard
    pile. Unconscious characters cannot quest, attack, defend, collect resources,
    trigger abilities, be poisoned, or ready (except by effects that target
    unconscious characters).
    
    
    When a card effect instructs a player to “ready an unconscious character,”
    that player chooses an unconscious character and rotates that character 180
    degrees so that it appears in its ready position. That character is now
    ready and is no longer considered to be unconscious.
    
    
    If any number of poison is removed from a character, or that character leaves
    play, then those poison cards are placed in their owner’s discard pile.
victory:
  title: Victory
  text: >
    Victory is a keyword ability. When an enemy or location with the victory 
    keyword is defeated or explored, it is placed in the victory display
    instead of the encounter discard pile.
    
    
    The victory keyword appears on the lower right portion of a card and is not
    considered to be part of the card’s text box. Card effects that blank a 
    card’s text box do not blank the victory keyword.
    
    
    At the end of the game, victory points in the victory display are applied
    to the group’s score.
victory display:
  title: Victory Display

    value. Resource tokens placed on a location or quest this way are villager 
    tokens. Villager tokens do not count as resources
when:
  title: When
  text: >
    The word “when” refers to a game occurrence that is underway but not yet
    concluded. Some response abilities use the word “when” to specify the
    timing of their triggering condition.
