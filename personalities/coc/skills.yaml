Accounting:
  page: 57
  text: >
    grants understanding of accountancy procedures and reveals the financial functioning of a business or person.
    Inspecting the books, one might detect cheated employees, siphoned off funds, payment of bribes or blackmail, and
    whether the financial condition is better or worse than claimed. Looking through old accounts, one could see how
    money was gained or lost in the past (grain, slave-trading, whiskey-running, etc.) and to whom and for what payment
    was made.

Animal Handling:
  page: 57
  text: >
    is the ability to command and train domesticated animals to
    perform simple tasks. The skill is most commonly applied to
    dogs but may include birds, cats, monkeys, and so on (at the
    Keeper’s discretion). For riding animals, such as horses or
    camels, the Ride skill is used for breaking in and controlling
    such mounts.

Anthropology:
  page: 57
  text: >
    enables the user to identify and understand an individual’s
    way of life through observation. If the skill-user observes
    another culture from within for a time, or works from
    accurate records concerning an extinct culture, then simple
    predictions can be made about that culture’s ways and morals,
    even though the evidence may be incomplete. Studying the
    culture for a month or more, the anthropologist begins to
    understand how the culture functions and, in combination
    with Psychology, may predict the actions and beliefs of those
    being studied.

Appraise:
  page: 57
  text: >
    is used to estimate the value of a particular item, including the
    quality, material used, and workmanship. Where relevant,
    the skill-user could pinpoint the age of the item, assess its
    historical relevance, and detect forgeries.


    **Push examples**: checking an item’s validity with another
    expert; conducting testing; researching an item.

Track:
  page: 78
  text: >
    enables an investigator to follow a person, vehicle, or
    animal over earth, and through plants/leaves. Factors such
    as time passed since the tracks were made, rain, and the type
    of ground covered may affect the difficulty level.
  
    **Push examples**: backtracking and taking more time to
    study the area; walking in increasing spirals to locate the
    tracks (taking longer, possibly making more noise and making
    oneself more visible).

Throw:
  page: 77
  text: >
    is used to hit a target with an object or to hit a target with the right
    part of the object thrown (such as the blade of a knife or
    a hatchet), use Throw.
    
    A palm-sized object of reasonable balance can be hurled up to STR in yards.
    
    If the Throw roll fails, the object lands at a random
    distance from the target. The Keeper should compare the
    closeness of the die roll result to the highest number which
    would have indicated success and choose a distance between
    the target and object that feels comparable.
    
    The Throw skill is used in combat when throwing rocks,
    spears, grenades, or boomerangs.
    
    Once an item has been thrown, it is quite literally out of
    the investigator’s hands and therefore there is nothing the
    player can do to justify a pushed roll. If multiple missiles
    are available, there is no risk connected with failure, and it
    is only a matter of time until the investigator is successful,
    don’t roll dice.

    **Push examples**: taking more time to assess the distance
    or waiting some time for more favorable conditions; putting
    every ounce of strength into the throw and throwing yourself
    as you launch the item; throwing a lot of items in quick succession
    hoping one will hit the target; taking a massive runup
    and risking your momentum taking you over the ravine.

Swim:
  page: 77
  text: >
    is the ability to float and to move through water or other liquid.
    Only roll Swim in times of crisis or danger, or when the
    Keeper judges it appropriate. Failing a pushed Swim roll can
    result in loss of hit points. It may also lead to the person being
    washed away downstream, partially or completely drowned.

    **Push examples**: taking a big breath and really ‘going for it’
    with all your remaining strength; pushing your physical limits.

Survival:
  page: 77
  text: >
    provides the expertise required to survive in
    extreme environments, such as in
    desert or arctic conditions, as well as
    upon the sea or in wilderness terrain.
    Inherent is the knowledge of hunting,
    building shelters, hazards (such as the
    avoidance of poisonous plants), etc.,
    according to the given environment.
    You may spend skill points to
    purchase any skill specialization.
    The generic Survival skill cannot be
    purchased. An environment specialism
    should be determined when this
    skill is chosen, for example: Survival
    (Desert), (Sea), (Arctic), etc. When a
    character does not have the obvious
    survival specialty, they may roll
    against an allied specialty with the
    level of difficulty increased (or Penalty die) at the Keeper’s
    discretion.
  
    **Push examples**: trying something risky (e.g. drinking the
    water without purifying it first; eating unidentified berries);
    using all of one’s clothing to improve a shelter; burning
    every possession to make a signal fire.

Stealth:
  page: 76
  text: >
    is the art of moving quietly and hiding without alerting those
    who might hear or see. When attempting to avoid detection,
    use a Stealth skill roll. Ability with the skill suggests either
    that the character is adept at moving quietly (light-footed)
    or skilled in camouflage techniques. The skill might also
    suggest that the character can maintain a level of patience
    and cool-headedness to remain still and unseen for long
    periods.
  
    **Push examples**: taking more time to study the area; removing
    your shoes; causing a distraction; sitting tight until
    the coast appears clear.

Spot Hidden:
  page: 76
  text: >
    allows the user to spot a secret door or compartment,
    notice a hidden intruder, find an inconspicuous clue,
    recognize a repainted automobile, become aware of ambushers,
    notice a bulging pocket, or anything similar. This is
    an important skill in the armory of an investigator.
    When an investigator is searching for a character who is
    hiding, the opponent’s Stealth skill is used to set the difficulty
    level for the roll.
    If a character has only a fleeting chance to spot something,
    perhaps while running past it, the Keeper may raise the level
    of difficulty. If the character is conducting a thorough search,
    the Keeper might award an automatic success. The difficulty
    level might also be adapted to reflect the environment, it
    being harder to spot something is a cluttered room.
  
  
    **Push examples**: taking more time to observe the area;
    pulling the place apart; dismantling the furniture and
    smashing the porcelain statuettes.

Sleight of Hand:
  page: 76
  text: >
    allows the visual covering-up, secreting, or masking of an
    object or objects, perhaps with debris, cloth, or other intervening
    or illusion-promoting materials, perhaps by using a secret
    panel or false compartment. Larger objects of any sort should
    be increasingly hard to conceal. Sleight of hand includes pickpocketing,
    palming a card, and clandestine use of a cell phone.
  
    **Push examples**: taking more time to study the target and
    their behaviors; physically touching or bumping into the target;
    setting up an elaborate rig inside one’s jacket to conceal a
    card or loaded dice; having someone cause a distraction.

Science:
  page: 73
  text: >
    is the practical and theoretical ability with a science specialty
    and suggests some degree of formalized education and
    training, although a well-read amateur scientist may also be
    a possibility. Understanding and scope is limited by the era
    of play. You may spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization.
    The generic Science skill cannot be purchased.
    Each specialty covers a particular discipline and the list
    given is not exhaustive. Many specialties cross and overlap
    in knowledge, for example Mathematics and Cryptography,
    Botany and Biology, Chemistry and Pharmacy. When a
    character does not have the obvious discipline specialty,
    they may roll against an allied specialty with the level of difficulty
    increased (or a Penalty die) at the Keeper’s discretion.
  
    **Push examples**: taking more time for study; conducting
    further research (perhaps in a better-equipped laboratory);
    consulting another expert; taking risks.

Ride:
  page: 73
  text: >
    is intended to apply to saddle horses, donkeys,
    and mules, granting knowledge of basic care of the riding
    animal, riding gear, and how to handle the steed at a gallop
    or on difficult terrain. Should a steed unexpectedly rear or
    stumble, the rider’s chance of remaining mounted equals
    his or her Ride skill. Riding sidesaddle increases the level of
    difficulty by one level. An unfamiliar mount (such as a camel)
    might be ridden successfully, but the level of difficulty
    would be higher.
  
    If an investigator falls from a mount, either because the
    animal has collapsed, fallen or died (or because a pushed
    Ride roll failed), at least 1D6 hit points are lost in the accident—
    although a Jump roll can negate this loss.
  
    **Push examples**: whipping or pushing the mount aggressively—
    perhaps forcing a horse to jump a ravine or high
    ditch; taking the risk of keeping your mount rather than
    jumping clear as trouble approaches.

Read Lips:
  page: 73
  text: >
    allows the inquisitive investigator to listen-in on a
    conversation, without requiring them to hear the speakers.
    Line of sight is necessary, and if only one speaker’s lips can be
    seen (the other presumably with their back to the lip reader)
    then only half of the conversation can be deciphered.
    Read Lips may also be used to silently communicate
    with another person (if both are proficient), allowing for
    relatively complex phrasing and meaning.
  
    **Push examples**: putting yourself in an obvious position
    and staring unsubtly at the target(s); filming the target (and
    thus likely to be observed filming the target).

Psychology:
  page: 72
  text: >
    is a perception skill common to all humans, it allows the
    user to study an individual and form an idea of another
    person’s motives and character. The Keeper may choose to
    make concealed Psychology skill rolls on the player’s behalf,
    announcing only the information, true or false, that the user
    gained by employing it.
  
    **Push examples**: being very unsubtle and asking highly
    personal, intimate, or downright direct questions of the target;
    immersing yourself in data regarding a specific person
    (the target of your study) in order to think like them and
    understand their motivations.

Psychoanalysis:
  page: 72
  text: >
    refers to the range of emotional therapies, not just
    to Freudian procedures. Formal psychotherapy was still in
    its infancy in the 1890s, though some procedures are as old
    as humanity. Sometimes it was looked on as a fraudulent
    study, even in the 1920s. The common term then for an
    analyst or scholar of emotional disorders was "alienist". In
    the present day, a combination of therapies has evolved, and
    this skill now could be justly named Psychiatric Treatment.
    
    Intensive psychoanalysis can return Sanity points to
    an investigator patient. Once per game month, to learn
    the progress of the therapy, make a 1D100 roll against the
    analyst or doctor’s Psychoanalysis skill. If the roll succeeds,
    the patient gains 1D3 Sanity points. If the roll fails, add no
    points. If the roll is fumbled, then the patient loses 1D6 Sanity
    points, and treatment by that analyst concludes: there
    has been some sort of serious incident or dramatic setback
    in the therapy, and the relationship between patient and
    therapist has broken down beyond saving.
    
    In the game, psychoanalysis alone does not speed recovery
    from indefinite insanity, which requires 1D6 months of
    institutional (or similar) care, of which psychotherapy may
    form a part.
    
    Successful use of this skill can allow a character to cope
    with the subject of a phobia or mania for a short time, or
    to see delusions for what they are. In play, this would allow
    for an insane investigator to ignore the effects of a phobia
    or mania for a brief period, allowing a claustrophobe to
    hide in a broom cupboard for ten minutes, for example.
    Equally a person might make a Psychoanalysis roll to help
    a delusional investigator see through their hallucination for
    a brief period.
    
    Treatment by a psychotherapist can add Sanity points
    during indefinite insanity.
    
    Psychoanalysis cannot increase a person’s Sanity points
    above 99–Cthulhu Mythos.
  
    **Push examples**: this is a skill that can be attempted
    month after month without requiring a pushed skill roll.
    However, if one failed the skill roll in a given month, one
    might choose to push a roll during a single session on the
    following day with some form of radical intervention (if a
    quick result was required). For example: forcing a patient to
    face their fear by actively forcing them to confront its physical
    reality; getting the patient’s friends and close colleagues
    to actively participate in the therapy.

Pilot:
  page: 71
  text: >
    is the air or water equivalent of Drive Automobile, this is the
    maneuver skill for flying or floating craft. You may spend skill
    points to purchase any skill specialization. The generic Pilot
    skill cannot be purchased. An investigator might have several
    versions of this skill in the spaces on the investigator sheet (such
    as Pilot Aircraft, Pilot Dirigible, etc.) Each starts at 01%.
    Anyone with modest skill can sail or fly on a calm day
    with good visibility, although skill rolls are required for
    storms, navigation by instrument, low visibility, and other
    difficult situations. Bad weather, poor visibility, and damage
    may raise the difficulty level of skill rolls to pilot air and
    watercraft.
  
    **Push examples**: pulling the aircraft up and making a
    second and final attempt at landing; pushing the vehicle to
    its limit; making a risky maneuver to lose a pursuer.

Persuade:
  page: 71
  text: >
    is used to convince a target about a particular idea,
    concept, or belief through reasoned argument, debate, and
    discussion. Persuade may be employed without reference to
    truth. The successful application of Persuade takes time: at
    least half an hour. If you want to persuade someone quickly,
    you should use Fast Talk.
    Depending on the goal expressed by the player, if the
    investigator takes sufficient time, the effect may linger indefinitely
    and insidiously; for years perhaps, until events or
    another Persuade turn the target’s mind in another direction.
    Persuade may be used for bargaining, to haggle the price
    of an item or service down. If successful, the seller is thoroughly
    convinced that they have struck a good deal.
  
    **Push examples**: getting close and personal to advance
    your argument or appeal to the target’s reason; demonstrating
    through logical reasoning and examples, in detail;
    using carefully preplanned suggestion techniques (possibly
    also subliminal messages) to make the target as receptive as
    possible; putting on a grand show (staging, fireworks, free
    gifts, free drinks, bribes, etc.) in order to really push your
    point of view front-and-center for a group of people.
    Remember that this is Persuade; if the investigator begins
    to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for
    a different skill to be used. If threats are used, it may become
    Intimidate; or if the investigator is relying on befriending
    the target, it may become Charm. Switching from one to the
    other to gain a second roll still constitutes a pushed roll.

Operate Heavy Machinery:
  page: 71
  text: >
    is required to drive and operate a tank, backhoe, steam
    shovel, or other large-scale construction machine. For very
    different sorts of machines, the Keeper may decide to raise
    the difficulty level if the problems encountered are mostly
    unfamiliar ones; someone used to running a bulldozer, for
    instance, will not be quickly competent with the steam turbines
    in a ship’s engine room.
  
    **Push examples**: going step-by-step with the operating
    manual; taking time to practice; seeking a teacher.

Occult:
  page: 70
  text: >
    The user recognizes occult paraphernalia, words, and concepts,
    as well as folk traditions, and can identify grimoires
    of magic and occult codes. The occultist is familiar with
    the families of secret knowledge passed down from Egypt
    and Sumer, from the Medieval and Renaissance West, and
    perhaps from Asia and Africa as well.
    
    Comprehending certain books may provide skill points
    of Occult. This skill does not apply to spells, books, and the
    magic of the Cthulhu Mythos, although occult ideas are
    often adopted by worshipers of the Great Old Ones.
    Whether non-Mythos magic is real or fraudulent in your
    game is for the Keeper to determine.
  
    **Push examples**: taking more time to study the site or
    item; conducting further research; consulting another
    expert; purging oneself and undertaking extreme personal
    preparation in advance of ritual performance.

Navigate:
  page: 70
  text: >
    Allows the user to find his or her way in storms or clear
    weather, in day or at night. Those of higher skill are familiar
    with astronomical tables, charts, instruments, and satellite
    location gear as they exist in the era of play. One could also
    use this skill to measure and map an area (cartography),
    whether an island of many square miles or the interior of
    a single room—use of modern technology may lower or
    negate the difficultly level.

    Rolls for this skill may be made as concealed rolls by the
    Keeper—a matter for the investigators to attempt, and later
    witness the results.

    If the character is familiar with the area, a bonus die
    should be granted to the roll.
  
    **Push examples**: getting the map out and delaying while
    you attempt to work out where you are; going back to where
    you started from and trying again.

Natural World:
  page: 69
  text: >
    Originally the study of plant and animal life in its environment.
    By the nineteenth century, this study had long
    separated into a range of academic disciplines (Biology,
    Botany, etc.) As a skill, Natural World represents the traditional
    (unscientific) knowledge and personal observation of
    farmers, fishermen, inspired amateurs, and hobbyists. It can
    identify species, habits, and habitats in a general way, and
    identify tracks, spoors, and calls, as well as allowing guesses
    as to what may be important to a particular species. For a
    scientific understanding of the natural world, one should
    look to the Biology, Botany, and Zoology skills.
    Natural World may or may not be accurate—this is the
    region of appreciation, judgment, folk tradition, and enthusiasm.
    Use Natural World to judge horseflesh at the county
    fair, or decide whether a butterfly collection is excellent or
    just excellently framed.
  
    **Push examples**: spending much longer (forgetful of the
    time) examining the habitat; tasting the unknown mushroom
    or plant to get a better idea what it is; consulting with
    the old woman in the village about the local wildlife.

Medicine:
  page: 69
  text: >
    The user diagnoses and treats accidents, injuries, diseases,
    poisonings, etc., and makes public health recommendations.
    If an era has no good treatment for a malady, the
    effort is limited, uncertain, or inconclusive. The Medicine
    skill grants knowledge of a wide variety of drugs and potions,
    natural and man-made, and understanding of the
    side effects and contraindications.
    
    Treatment using the Medicine skill takes a minimum
    of one hour and can be delivered any time after damage
    is taken, but if this is not performed on the same day, the
    difficulty level is increased (requiring a Hard success). A
    person treated successfully with Medicine recovers 1D3 hit
    points (in addition to any First Aid they have received),
    except in the case of a dying character, who must initially
    receive successful First Aid to stabilized them before a
    Medicine roll is made.
    
    A character is limited to one treatment of First Aid and
    Medicine until further damage is taken (except in the case
    of a dying character who may require stabilizing with First
    Aid multiple times). Successful use of Medicine can rouse
    an unconscious person to consciousness.
    
    In treating Major Wounds, successful use of the Medicine
    skill provides the patient a Bonus die on their weekly
    recovery roll.
    
    The Keeper may grant automatic success for medical
    treatment in a contemporary, well-equipped hospital.
  
    **Push examples**: consulting with colleagues; conducting
    further research; trying something experimental or more
    risky; performing some form of clinical experiment.

Mechanical Repair:
  page: 69
  text: >
    This skill allows the investigator to repair a broken machine
    or to create a new one. Basic carpentry and plumbing projects
    can be performed, as well as constructing items (such
    as a pulley system) and repairing items (such as a steam
    pump). Special tools or parts may be required. This skill
    can be used to open common household locks, but nothing
    more advanced—see the Locksmith skill for more complex
    locks. Mechanical Repair is a companion skill to Electrical
    Repair, and both may be necessary to fix complex devices,
    such as a car or an aircraft.
  
    **Push examples**: completely dismantling the device;
    taking longer; risk using excessive force to knock the device
    into action (e.g. hitting the thing till it works).

Locksmith:
  page: 68
  text: >
    A locksmith can open car doors, hot-wire autos, jimmy
    library windows, figure out Chinese puzzle boxes, and penetrate
    ordinary commercial alarm systems. The user may repair
    locks, make keys, or open locks with the aid of skeleton
    keys, picks, and other tools. Especially difficult locks may
    require a higher difficulty level.
  
    **Push examples**: completely dismantling the lock; taking
    longer; using force to pry the mechanism.

Listen:
  page: 68
  text: >
    measures the ability of an investigator to interpret and understand
    sound, including overheard conversations, mutters
    behind a closed door, and whispered words in a cafe. The
    Keeper may use it to determine the course of an impending
    encounter: was your investigator awakened by that cracking
    twig? By extension, a high Listen skill can indicate a good
    level of general awareness in a character.
  
    **Push examples**: stopping dead still and listening; getting
    closer to the presumed source (e.g. putting your ear to the
    train track or the door); telling everyone to be quiet (making
    a noise yourself) and then listening.

Library Use:
  page: 67
  text: >
    Library Use enables an investigator to find a piece
    of information, such as a certain book, newspaper,
    or reference in a library, collection of documents,
    or database, assuming the item is there. Use of this
    skill marks several hours of continuous search.
    This skill can locate a locked case or rare-book special
    collection, but Persuade, Fast Talk, Charm, Intimidate,
    Credit Rating, or special credentials may have to be used to
    get access to the books or information in question.
  
    **Push examples**: pressing the librarian for extensive assistance;
    taking longer to systematically work through the stacks.

Law:
  page: 67
  text: >
    represents the chance of knowing pertinent law,
    precedent, legal maneuvers, or court procedure.
    The practice of law as a profession can lead to great
    rewards and political office, but it requires intense
    application over many years—a high Credit Rating
    is also usually crucial in this regard. In the United
    States, the State Bar of a particular commonwealth
    or state must sanction one’s practice of law.
    
    When in a foreign country, it is suggested that
    the level of difficulty be increased when using this
    skill, unless the character has spent many months
    studying that nation’s legal system.
  
    **Push examples**: delaying to consider your
    argument; explaining in high detail the nuances
    of the case/situation; taking significant time to
    conduct research; bending the letter of the law to
    drive your argument.

Language:
  page: 66
  text: >
    *Own*: When choosing this skill, the exact language must be
    specified and written next to the skill. In infancy and early
    childhood, most humans use a single language. The tongue
    chosen by the player for the Own Language automatically
    starts as equal to the investigator’s EDU characteristic;
    thereafter, the investigator understands, speaks, reads, and
    writes at that percentage or higher (if further skill points are
    added during investigator creation).
  
    **Push examples**: see Language (Other) skill., Other (Specializations)


    *Other (Specialization)*: When choosing this skill, the exact language must be specified
    and written next to the skill. An individual can know
    any number of languages. The skill represents the user’s
    chance to understand, speak, read, and write in a language
    other than his or her own.
    Ancient or unknown languages (such as Aklo, Hyperborean,
    etc.) should not be chosen (unless agreed with the
    Keeper,) but ordinary Earthly languages may be. The Keeper
    may raise the difficulty level if archaic speech or writing in
    that language is encountered. A single successful Other Language
    roll normally allows comprehension of an entire book.
    Suggestions regarding the Other Languages skill:
    
    ⦁ At 5% skill a language can be correctly identified
    without need for a roll.
    
    ⦁ At 10% skill simple ideas can be communicated.
    
    ⦁ At 30% transactional requests can be understood.
    
    ⦁ At 50% skill a person is fluent.
    
    ⦁ At 75% skill in a character can pass for a native
    speaker of a foreign language.
    
    ⦁ To identify a present-day human language
    (unknown to the investigator), use an EDU roll.
    
    ⦁ To identify an extinct human language, use an
    Archaeology or History roll.
    
    ⦁ To identify an alien language, use a Cthulhu Mythos
    or possibly an Occult roll.
  
    **Push examples**: taking longer to think through the words
    you want to say; taking long pauses to answer what you have
    been told; referencing other books to make a translation.

Jump:
  page: 66
  text: >
    With success, the investigator may leap up or down vertically,
    or jump horizontally from a standing or running start. When
    falling, Jump may be used to lessen the potential fall damage.

    Judgment must be exercised as to what constitutes a
    regular jump, a hard jump, or an extreme jump (respectively
    requiring Regular success, Hard success, and Extreme success).
    As a guide, a Regular success would be required for an
    investigator to safely leap down vertically to his or her own
    height, jump horizontally from a standing start across a gap
    for a distance equal to the jumper’s own height, or run and
    then jump horizontally to a distance of twice the jumper’s
    own height. One might achieve double this distance with an
    Extreme success, although bear in mind the world record for
    the long jump is around 29 feet.

    If falling from a height, a successful Jump prepares for
    the fall, reducing resultant damage by half.
  
    **Push examples**: delaying and taking time to assess the
    jump; throwing all your weight and force behind the jump—
    really stretching for it. In some instances a pushed roll is not
    possible; if one leaps across an abyss one cannot have a second
    attempt. However, if one is trapped in a pit and jumping to
    escape, one could have any number of attempts, which would
    then be summarized by one pushed skill roll.

Intimidate:
  page: 66
  text: >
    Intimidation can take many forms, including physical force,
    psychological manipulation, and threats. It is used to frighten
    or compel a person to act in a certain way. Intimidate is
    opposed by Intimidate or Psychology.

    Backing up intimidation with a weapon or some other
    powerful threat or incentive may reduce the difficulty
    level. When pushing an Intimidation roll, one possible
    consequence of failure is carrying out one’s threat, perhaps
    beyond the level of that which was intended.

    Intimidate may be used to force down the price of an
    item or service. If successful, the seller is may reduce the
    price, or hand the item over free of charge—depending on
    the situation, they may later report the incident to the police
    or to members of the local organized crime gang.
  
    **Push examples**: Causing actual physical harm to the target
    or to something or someone that the target cares about.
    Remember that this is Intimidation; if the investigator begins
    to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for
    a different skill to be used. If the threats are retracted and the
    investigator then tries to befriend the target, it may become
    Charm; or if a protracted and unthreatening discussion
    ensues, it may become Persuade. Switching from one to the
    other to gain a second roll still constitutes a pushed roll.

Hypnosis:
  page: 65
  text: >
    The user is able to induce a trance-like state in a willing target
    who experiences heightened suggestibility, relaxation, and
    possible recall of forgotten memories. The limits of hypnotism
    should be decided by the Keeper to fit their game;
    it may be that only willing subjects can be hypnotized, or
    the Keeper may allow it to be used on unwilling targets in
    a more aggressive manner. Using hypnosis is usually an
    opposed roll (opposed by the POW or Psychology skill of
    the target).

    This skill may be utilized as hypnotherapy on those
    suffering mental trauma, reducing the effects of a phobia
    or mania in a patient: successful use means that the patient
    overcomes the phobia or mania on one occasion. Note that a
    series of successful hypnotherapy sessions may be needed to
    fully cure someone of a phobia (minimum of 1D6 sessions,
    at the Keeper’s discretion).
  
    **Push examples**: increasing your influence on the target
    by ensuring their full and undivided attention; assaulting
    the target’s senses with confusing lights or props; the use
    of drugs to make the target more susceptible to suggestion.

History:
  page: 65
  text: >
    Enables an investigator to remember the significance of a
    country, city, region, or person, as pertinent. A successful
    roll might be used to help identify tools, techniques, or ideas
    familiar to ancestors, but little known today.
  
    **Push examples**: taking more time to examine; conducting
    further research; consulting another expert; hiring assistants
    to conduct detailed research,
    taking months, and at a huge cost.

First Aid:
  page: 65
  text: >
    The user is able to provide emergency medical care. This might encompass: applying a splint to a broken leg, stemming
    bleeding, treating a burn, resuscitating a drowning victim, dressing and cleaning a wound, etc. First Aid cannot be used
    to treat diseases (where the Medicine skill is required).
    
    To be effective, First Aid must be delivered within one
    hour, in which case it grants 1 hit point. It may be attempted once, with subsequent attempts constituting a pushed roll.
    Two people can work together to administer First Aid, with a success granted if either one of them rolls a success. Successful
    use of First Aid can rouse an unconscious person to consciousness. A character is limited to one successful
    treatment of First Aid and Medicine until further damage is taken.
    
    When treating a dying character, successful First Aid
    stabilizes him or her for one hour and grants 1 temporary
    hit point. At the end of the hour, and each hour thereafter,
    the character must make a successful CON roll to remain
    stabilized, otherwise (with a failed CON roll) the character
    is dying and loses the temporary hit point, and must now
    make a CON roll per round thereafter to stave-off death. If
    the character survives until the following round, First Aid
    can be attempted again (by up to two individuals). This
    can be continued (without constituting a pushed roll) until
    stabilization or death.
    
    First Aid (and only First Aid) can save the life of a dying
    character, after which they must receive a successful Medicine
    roll, or be hospitalized. Thus, First Aid is an important
    skill to have, alongside Medicine, if you wish to be an effective
    medic.
  
    **Push examples**: taking longer to treat the patient; employing high risk methods to stabilize the wound.

Firearms:
  page: 64
  text: >
    Covers all manner of firearms, as well as bows and crossbows. You may spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization.
    The generic Firearms skill cannot be purchased. Choose specializations appropriate to your investigator’s occupation and history.
  
    *Note*: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Fighting:
  page: 64
  text: >
    The Fighting skill denotes a character’s skill in melee combat. You may spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization. The generic Fighting skill cannot be purchased.
    Choose fighting specializations appropriate to your investigator’s occupation and history.Those starting the game with a Fighting (Brawl) skill of 50% or higher may wish to choose some type of formal training as part of their background to account for his or her
    skill level. A myriad of fighting styles exist, each with its own pros and cons. Martial arts are simply a way of developing a person’s Fighting skill. Decide how the character learned to fight, whether it be formal military training, martial arts
    classes, or learned the hard way as a result of street-fighting. The term "brawl" might feel too crude for a skilled martial artist and could be replaced (with Karate for example) if a player so wished.
  
    *note*: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Fast Talk:
  page: 64
  text: >
    Fast Talk is specifically limited to verbal trickery, deception,
    and misdirection, such as bamboozling a bouncer to let you
    inside a club, getting someone to sign a form they haven’t
    read, making a policeman look the other way, and so on. The skill is opposed by Psychology or Fast Talk. After a brief
    period (usually after the fast talker has left the scene) the
    target will realize that they have been conned. The effect of
    Fast Talk is always temporary, though it will last longer if a
    Hard success is achieved.

    Fast Talk may be used to haggle the price of an item or
    service down. If successful, the seller momentarily thinks that
    they have struck a good deal; however, if the buyer returns
    and attempts to purchase another item, the seller may well
    refuse further haggling and even increase the price in order to
    recoup what they lost on the previous sale!
  
    **Push examples**: getting up close and personal to the
    target; talking outlandishly, aiming to confuse the target.
    Remember this is Fast Talk, so if the investigator begins
    to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for a
    different skill to be used; if threats are used, it may become
    Intimidate, or if a protracted discussion ensues, it may become
    Persuade. Switching from one to the other to gain a
    second roll still constitutes a pushed roll.

Electrical Repair:
  page: 63
  text: >
    Enables the investigator to repair or reconfigure electrical
    equipment, such as auto ignitions, electric motors, fuse boxes,
    and burglar alarms. In the present day, this skill has little
    to do with the Electronics skill. Fixing an electrical device
    may require special parts or tools. Jobs in the 1920s may call
    for this skill and for Mechanical Repair in combination.
    Electrical Repair may also be used in conjunction with
    modern explosives, such as blasting caps, C-4 plastic explosives,
    and mines. These weapons are designed to be easy to
    deploy; only a fumble result will lead to misfire (remember
    the roll can be pushed). Defusing explosives is far trickier, as
    they may be fitted with anti-tamper mechanisms; raise the
    level of difficulty when disarming explosives—see Demolitions
    skill.

    **Push examples**: taking longer to repair or reconfigure
    the equipment; taking a risky short-cut.

Electronics [modern]:
  page: 63
  parent: modern skills
  aliases:
    - electronics
  text: >
    For troubleshooting and repairing electronic equipment.
    Allows simple electronic devices to be made. This is a skill
    for the present day—use Physics and Electrical Repair for
    electronic developments of the 1920s.

    Unlike the Electrical Repair skill, parts needed for electronics
    work often cannot be jury-rigged: they are designed
    for precise jobs. Often without the right microchip or circuit
    board, the skill user is out of luck unless they can contrive
    some form of workaround.
  
    **Push examples**: taking longer to construct or repair a
    device; researching new or other methodologies.

Drive Auto:
  page: 63
  text: >
    Anyone with this skill can drive a car or light truck, make
    ordinary maneuvers, and cope with ordinary vehicle
    problems. If the investigator wants to lose a pursuer or tail
    someone, a Drive roll would be appropriate.

    Some other cultures might replace this skill with a
    comparative one: the Inuit might use Drive Dogsled, or a
    Victorian might use Drive Carriage.
  
    **Push examples**: driving the vehicle to its limit; not slowing
    down, regardless of the risk.

Dodge:
  page: 63
  text: >
    Allows an investigator to instinctively evade blows, thrown
    missiles, and so forth. A character may attempt to use dodge
    any number of times in a combat round (but only once per
    attack). Dodge can increase through experience, like other
    skills. If an attack can be seen, a character can try to dodge
    it. It is impossible to dodge bullets because they cannot be
    seen when in motion; the best a character can do is to take
    evasive action that results in being harder to hit (see Diving
    for Cover in the Call of Cthulhu Rulebook).
  
    *note*: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Diving:
  page: 62
  text: >
    is the use and maintenance of diving
    equipment for swimming underwater, including underwater
    navigation, proper weighting, and emergency procedures.
    Prior to the invention of the Aqua-Lung in 1942, rigid
    diving suits were worn with air pumped from the surface
    through a connecting tube.

    In the modern age, a scuba diver will be familiar with
    the physics of diving, air pressure, and the physiological
    processes that occur when breathing with pressurized air.
  
    **Push examples**: pushing the limits of the equipment;
    methodically double-checking equipment; gaining professional
    assistance.

Disguise:
  page: 62
  text: >
    To be used whenever you wish to appear to be someone
    other than whom you are. The user changes posture, costume,
    and/or voice to enact a disguise, posing as another
    person or another sort of person. Theatrical makeup may
    help, as will fake ID. *Note* that to pass as a specific person in a face-to-face
    meeting with someone who knows the person being imitated
    is beyond the scope of this skill, and may well indicate
    the need for a combined skill roll at a higher difficulty (with
    Persuade, Charm, or Fast Talk).
  
    **Push examples**: undergoing a fully immersive and
    intensive preparation (losing oneself in the role); stealing
    personal items and utilizing them in the disguise; overt exaggeration
    to confound the target; feigning a sudden attack
    of illness to disorientate the observer.

Demolitions:
  page: 62
  text: >
    With this skill the user is familiar in the safe use of demolitions,
    including setting and defusing explosive charges.
    Mines and similar devices are designed to be easy to set (no
    roll required) and more difficult to remove or defuse.

    This skill also encompasses military-grade demolitions
    (anti-personnel mines, plastique, etc.)

    Given enough time and resources, those proficient may
    rig charges to demolish a building, clear a blocked tunnel,
    and repurpose explosive devises (such as constructing lowyield
    charges, booby-traps, and so on).
  
    **Push examples**: taking until the very last second to defuse
    the bomb; double-checking all the circuits/connections by hand.

Cthulhu Mythos:
  page: 61
  text: >
    This skill reflects understanding of the inhuman (Lovecraftian)
    Cthulhu Mythos. It is not founded on the accumulation
    of knowledge as academic skills are. Rather, it represents the
    opening and tuning of the human mind to the Cthulhu
    Mythos. Thus, Cthulhu Mythos skill derived from encountering
    Deep Ones (for example) is transferable to other
    situations and entities. Also referred to as "that which man
    should not know," the Cthulhu Mythos is antithetical to human
    understanding, and exposure to it undermines human
    sanity.

    No starting investigator may take points in Cthulhu
    Mythos as a starting skill (unless agreed with the Keeper).
    There is no tick-box for Cthulhu Mythos on the investigator
    sheet, as successful use of the skill does not offer an increase
    in the investigator’s percentiles in the skill. Instead, points in
    Cthulhu Mythos are gained by encounters with the Mythos
    that result in insanity, by insane insights into the true nature
    of the universe, and by reading forbidden books and other
    Mythos writings. A character’s Sanity may never be higher
    than 99 minus his or her Cthulhu Mythos skill. As Cthulhu
    Mythos points proliferate, they crowd out Sanity points,
    and leave the investigator vulnerable.

    Whenever spoor or other evidence of Mythos monsters
    is found, a successful roll against this skill allows the investigator
    to identify the entity, deduce something about its
    behavior or guess at some property it may possess. A successful
    Cthulhu Mythos roll might also allow an investigator
    to remember some fact concerning the Mythos, identify a
    spell by seeing it cast, remember that a particular spell or
    piece of information may be found in a particular Mythos
    tome, or achieve some other task. The Cthulhu Mythos skill
    may also be used to manifest magical spell-like effects.
  
    **Push examples**: getting closer to the creature for a
    better view; consulting dread tomes, or lore of humans (or
    otherwise) possessing specialist knowledge; conducting an
    autopsy to learn more; reading aloud as you retrace the
    strange cryptograms.

Credit Rating:
  page: 61
  text: >
    A measure of how prosperous and financially confident
    the investigator appears to be. Money opens doors; if the
    investigator is attempting to use his or her financial status
    to achieve a goal then use of the Credit Rating skill may be
    appropriate. Credit Rating can be used in place of APP to
    gauge first impressions. (i.e. wealthier people tend to dress
    in more expensive clothing).

    Credit Rating is not so much a skill as a gauge of financial
    wealth, and should not be ticked as other skills are. A high
    Credit Rating can be a useful resource in play, and so should
    be paid for with skill points when creating an investigator.
    Each occupation has a starting range for Credit Rating, and
    skill points should be spent to achieve a rating therein.

    Call of Cthulhu is not a game that requires money to be
    carefully tracked; however, it is useful to know the bounds
    of an investigator’s financial reach—for example, can the
    investigator afford to employ a team of archaeologists and
    workers to excavate an Egyptian tomb? An investigator’s
    Credit Rating can change over time. Investigators of the
    Cthulhu Mythos are prone to insanity, and this may lead to
    loss of employment and thus a lowering of the investigator’s
    Credit Rating score.
  
    **Push examples**: you offer your house and/or other valuables
    to secure money from a loan shark; you attempt to
    pressure the bank manager into giving you a loan.

Computer Use [Modern]:
  page: 60
  parent: modern skills
  aliases:
    - computer use
    - computer
  text: >
    This skill allows the investigator to program
    in various computer languages, retrieve and analyze
    obscure data, break into a secured system,
    explore a complicated network, and detect or
    exploit intrusions, back doors, and viruses. Special manipulation of a computer
    system may require this roll.

    The Internet places a wealth of information at the fingertips
    of an investigator. Use of the Internet to find highly
    specific or obscure information may require a combined
    dice roll for Computer Use and Library Use.

    This skill is not needed to use computers when surfing
    the Internet, collecting email, or to run regular commercially
    available software.
  
    **Push examples**: taking longer to develop a program;
    using another’s code as a shortcut; using untested software
    (e.g. a virus) to exploit a system.

Climb:
  page: 59
  text: >
    This skill allows a character to climb trees, walls and other
    vertical surfaces with or without ropes and climbing gear. The
    skill also encompasses rappeling.
    
    Conditions, such as firmness of surface, available handholds,
    wind, visibility, rain, etc., may all affect the difficulty level.
    Failing this skill on the first roll indicates that the climb
    is perhaps beyond the investigator’s capability. Failing a
    pushed roll is likely to indicate a fall with resultant damage.
    One successful Climb roll should allow the investigator tocomplete the climb in almost
    all cases (rather than
    requiring repeated rolls).
    
    A challenging or longer
    climb should have an increased
    difficulty level.
  
    **Push examples**: reassessing the climb; taking a longer route; straining one’s reach.

Charm:
  page: 59
  text: >
    Charm takes many forms, including physical attraction, seduction,
    flattery, or simply warmth of personality. Charm may be
    used to compel someone to act in a certain way, but not in a
    manner completely contrary to that person’s normal behavior.
    Charm is opposed by the Charm or Psychology skills.
    Charm may be used for bargaining, to haggle the price
    of an item or service down. If successful, the seller is won
    over and they may well reduce the price a little.

    **Push examples**: overtly flattering the target with affection;
    presenting an expensive gift; building trust by imparting
    a secret.
    
    Remember this is about being charming: if the investigator
    begins to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may
    ask for a different skill to be used; if threats are used, it may
    become Intimidation; or if a protracted discussion ensues, it
    may become Persuasion. Switching from one to the other to
    gain a second roll still constitutes a pushed roll.

Artillery:
  page: 59
  text: >
    This skill assumes some form of military training and experience.
    The user is experienced in the operation of field
    weapons in warfare, able to work in a crew or detachment
    to operate the projection of munitions beyond the range
    of personal weapons. Many weapons of this nature are too
    large for a single person to operate, and either an individual
    cannot use the weapon without a crew or the difficulty level
    should be raised (at the Keeper’s discretion, dependent on
    the type of weapon employed).

    Various specializations exist, depending on the period
    setting of the game, including cannon, howitzer, mortar,
    and rocket launcher.

    *note*: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Art and Craft:
  page: 58
  text: >
    The investigator sheet contains blank spaces for specializations
    of this skill, for example:

    Acting, Barber, Carpenter, Cobbler, Cook, Dancer, Fine Art, Forgery, Morris Dancer,
    Opera Singer, Painter & Decorator, Photographer, Potter, Sculptor, Writer, Woodwork
  
    Many of these examples are skills directly linked to a profession,
    but the skill may just be a leisure pursuit. You may
    spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization. The
    generic Art and Craft skill cannot be purchased.
    
    Ability with this skill may enable the making or repair
    of an item—something typically requiring equipment and
    time, to be determined by the Keeper if necessary. In a situation
    where graduations of success might be appropriate,
    a higher level of success indicates the item made is of high
    quality and/or precision.
    
    An art or craft skill might also be used to make a duplicate
    or fake item. In such a case, the difficulty level would
    depend on the intricacy and distinctiveness of the original
    to be copied. In the case of faking documentation, a specific
    specialization (Forgery) is used.
    
    A successful roll might provide information about an
    item, such as where or when it might have been made, some
    point of history or technique concerning it,
    or who might have made it. The holder of
    a specialization would have a breadth of
    knowledge within a particular field—
    knowledge of the subject, its history,
    and contemporary practitioners, as
    well as the ability to perform it.
  
    **Push examples**: reworking the
    object, piece or composition from
    scratch; conducting further research;
    checking with another expert.

Archaeology:
  page: 58
  text: >
    Allows dating and identification of artifacts from past cultures,
    and the detection of fakes. Ensures expertise in setting
    up and excavating a dig site. On inspecting a site, the user
    might deduce the purposes and way of life of those who left
    the remains. Anthropology might aid in this. Archaeology
    also helps identify written forms of extinct human languages.
  
    **Push examples**: taking more time to study the site or
    item; conducting further research; consulting another expert.
