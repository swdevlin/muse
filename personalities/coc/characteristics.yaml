Strength:
  aliases:
    - str

  text: >
    **STR**
    
    Strength measures the muscle power of an investigator. The
    higher it is, the more the investigator can lift or tightly cling
    to something. This characteristic determines the damage an
    investigator inflicts in hand-to-hand combat. Reduced to
    STR 0, an investigator is an invalid, unable to get out of bed.
Constitution:
  aliases:
    - con
  page: 30
  text: >
    **CON**
    
    Constitution represents health, vigor, and vitality. Poisons
    and diseases may directly challenge an investigator’s constitution.
    Investigators with a high constitution often have more
    hit points—the better to resist injury and attack. Serious
    physical injury or magical attack might lower the statistic, and
    if constitution reaches zero, the investigator dies.
Size:
  aliases:
    - siz
  page: 31

    **SIZ**
    
    Size averages both height and weight into a single number.
    To see over a wall, to squeeze through a small opening, or
    even to judge whose head might be sticking up out of the
    grass, use size. Size helps determine hit points and damage
    bonus and build. One might decrease SIZ to indicate the
    loss of a limb, though lowering DEX is more often the
    solution. Presumably if investigators lose all SIZ points they
    disappear—goodness knows to where!
Dexterity:
  aliases:
    - dex
  page: 31
  text: >
    **DEX**
    
    Investigators with higher Dexterity scores are quicker, nimbler
    and more physically flexible. A DEX roll might be made to grab
    a support to keep from falling, to move faster than an opponent,
    or to accomplish some delicate task. An investigator with zero
    DEX is uncoordinated and unable to perform physical tasks.
    
    In combat, the character with the highest DEX acts first.
Appearance:
  aliases:
    - app
  page: 31
  text: >
    **APP**
    
    Appearance measures both physical attractiveness and personality.
    A person with high APP is charming and likeable,
    but may lack conventional good looks. Someone with APP
    of 0 is appallingly ugly, possibly with a wholly detestable
    demeanor, provoking comment and shock everywhere.
    
    APP may be useful in social encounters or when trying
    to make a good impression.
Intelligence:
  aliases:
    - int
  page: 31
  text: >
    **INT**
    
    Intelligence represents how well investigators learn, remember,
    analyze information and solve complex puzzles. An
    investigator with zero INT is a babbling, drooling idiot.
    
    Intelligence determines the number of Personal Interest
    skill points (multiply INT × 2) allotted to a new investigator. INT also acts as the value
    for both Idea rolls and Intelligence rolls.
    
    If the amount of INT seems to contradict another characteristic,
    that’s another chance for roleplaying and further
    defining your investigator. For example, an investigator with
    high EDU and low INT might be a pedantic teacher or a
    sideshow performer, someone who knows facts but not their
    meanings. Conversely, high INT and low EDU might mean
    ignorance—such as an uneducated farm boy, new to the Big
    City—however this person would not be dull-witted.
Power:
  aliases:
    - pow
  page: 31
  text: >
    **POW**
    
    Power indicates force of will; the higher the POW, the higher
    the aptitude for, and resistance to, magic. An investigator
    with zero POW is zombie-like and without "purpose," as
    well as being unable to use magic. Unless stated otherwise,
    POW that is lost during the game is lost permanently.
    
    Sanity points (SAN) begin the game equal to the character’s
    POW. Sanity points are covered in more detail in
    Chapter 8: Sanity.
    
    POW dictates the character’s number of "magic points,"
    which, unlike POW, can be spent and regenerated during
    play. Magic points are equal to one-fifth of POW (see Chapter
    10: Magic).
    
    The POW of ordinary characters and investigators rarely
    changes. However, those adroit in the mysteries of the magic
    of the Cthulhu Mythos may be able to increase their personal
    POW.
Education:
  aliases:
    - edu
  page: 31
  text: >
    **EDU**
    
    Education is a measure of the formal and factual knowledge
    possessed by the investigator, as well as indicating the time
    the investigator has spent in full-time education. EDU measures
    retained information, not the intelligent application of
    that information (see Intelligence). An investigator without
    EDU would be like a newborn baby or an amnesiac—without
    knowledge of the world, probably very curious and
    credulous.
    
    An EDU of 60 suggests the investigator is a high school graduate,
    while a score of around 70 indicates a person with some
    college years. Those with an EDU greater than 80 have most likely
    conducted graduate level work and have a degree, as expected
    of a person who has been to a university of some kind. Note that
    sometimes a person with a high Education may not necessarily
    be schooled in the traditional sense, but rather may be self-taught
    and possess a highly studious and observant nature.
Luck:
  page: 31, 90
  text: >
    Luck rolls may be called for by the Keeper when circumstances
    external to any investigator are in question, and
    also when determining the fickle hand of fate. If a skill or
    characteristic is applicable to a situation then it should be
    used rather than Luck.
